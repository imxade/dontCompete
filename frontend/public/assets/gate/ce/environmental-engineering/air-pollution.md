**Air Pollution**
================

### Introduction

Air pollution refers to the presence of contaminants or pollutants in the air we breathe. These pollutants can be both natural and man-made, and they can have serious impacts on human health, the environment, and the climate.

### Core Concepts

#### Greenhouse Gases (GHGs)

*   GHGs absorb infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface and atmosphere.
*   This trapping of heat leads to an increase in global temperatures.
*   The main GHGs are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated gases.

#### Atmospheric Composition

*   The Earth's atmosphere is composed of:
    *   Nitrogen (N2): 78%
    *   Oxygen (O2): 21%
    *   Argon (Ar): 1%
    *   Carbon dioxide (CO2): 0.04%

### Key Formulas/Theorems

*   **Stoichiometric Reactions:**

$$\begin{aligned}
C(s) + O_2(g) & \rightarrow CO_2(g) \\
H_2(g) + \frac{1}{2}O_2(g) & \rightarrow H_2O(l)
\end{aligned}$$

*   **Oxygen Requirement:**

Given the composition of waste and the products formed, we can calculate the oxygen requirement using the balanced chemical equations.

### Problem Solving Patterns

#### Type 1: Oxygen Requirement Calculation

*   Calculate the theoretical oxygen required for complete combustion.
*   Use the atomic weights and percentages to determine the moles of each element.
*   Balance the chemical equation to find the mole ratio between oxygen and other elements.

#### Type 2: Stoichiometric Reactions

*   Write balanced chemical equations for the combustion reactions.
*   Calculate the molar mass of each product and reactant.
*   Use the mole ratios from the balanced equations to determine the theoretical amount of air required.

### Examples with Solutions

1.  **Example 1:** Oxygen Requirement Calculation
    *   Given: Waste composition (C = 35%, O = 26%, H = 10%, S = 6%, N = 3%), Burning rate (1000 tonnes/d).
    *   Assume complete conversion of C to CO2, H to H2O, S to SO2, and N to NOx.
    *   Calculate the oxygen requirement using the balanced chemical equations:

$$\begin{aligned}
C(s) + O_2(g) & \rightarrow CO_2(g) \\
H_2(g) + \frac{1}{2}O_2(g) & \rightarrow H_2O(l)
\end{aligned}$$

    *   Oxygen requirement = 6965 tonnes/d (Source: Q2)

2.  **Example 2:** Stoichiometric Reactions
    *   Given: Composition of dry solid waste, composition of air.
    *   Assume complete conversion of C to CO2, H to H2O, S to SO2, and N to NOx.
    *   Write balanced chemical equations for the combustion reactions:

$$\begin{aligned}
C(s) + O_2(g) & \rightarrow CO_2(g) \\
H_2(g) + \frac{1}{2}O_2(g) & \rightarrow H_2O(l)
\end{aligned}$$

    *   Calculate the theoretical amount of air required using the mole ratios from the balanced equations:

$$V = \frac{n_{O_2}}{n_{air}} \times V_{air}$$

### Common Pitfalls

*   Forgetting to balance chemical equations.
*   Not accounting for the oxygen already present in the waste.
*   Incorrectly calculating the mole ratios between reactants and products.

### Quick Summary

*   Greenhouse gases absorb infrared radiation, leading to an increase in global temperatures.
*   Atmospheric composition is primarily made up of nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), argon (Ar), and carbon dioxide (CO2).
*   Oxygen requirement calculation involves balancing chemical equations and determining the mole ratios between reactants and products.
