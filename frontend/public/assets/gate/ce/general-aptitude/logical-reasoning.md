**Logical Reasoning: Miscellaneous**
=====================================

### Introduction
---------------

This section covers miscellaneous logical reasoning concepts that appear in the GATE exam. These topics are crucial for solving problems related to motion, speed, and direction.

### Core Concepts
-----------------

* **Motion on a Spherical Surface**: When an object moves on the surface of a sphere (such as a globe), its path is curved due to the spherical geometry.
* **Speed and Velocity**: Speed refers to the rate at which an object covers distance, while velocity is a vector quantity that includes both speed and direction.

### Key Formulas/Theorems
-------------------------

None specific for this topic

### Problem Solving Patterns
-----------------------------

1.  **Analyzing Motion on a Spherical Surface**:
    *   Identify the type of motion (e.g., circular, rotational).
    *   Consider the effect of the spherical geometry on the object's path.
2.  **Comparing Speeds and Velocities**:
    *   Be cautious when comparing speeds or velocities along different paths or directions.
    *   Ensure that you are considering the correct components of velocity (e.g., tangential, normal).

### Examples with Solutions
---------------------------

Q1: (Source Question ID: ce_2023-N_10)

Consider a spherical globe rotating about an axis passing through its poles. There are three points P, Q, and R situated respectively on the equator, the north pole, and midway between the equator and the north pole in the northern hemisphere. Let vP, vQ, and vr represent their respective speeds.

Solution:

*   The speed of point P is greatest because it moves the farthest in a given time.
*   Since point Q is on the axis of rotation, its speed is zero (as it does not move relative to the rotating globe).
*   Point R moves at an angle between the equator and the north pole, so its speed is greater than that of PQ but less than that of vP.

Therefore, the correct option is:

(C) P > R > Q

### Common Pitfalls
-------------------

1.  **Misinterpreting Speed vs. Velocity**:
    *   Be aware that a higher speed does not necessarily imply a higher velocity.
2.  **Ignoring Spherical Geometry Effects**:
    *   Consider the curved path of objects moving on a spherical surface.

### Quick Summary
-----------------

*   Understand motion on a spherical surface and its effects on speed and velocity.
*   Be cautious when comparing speeds or velocities, considering both magnitude and direction.
