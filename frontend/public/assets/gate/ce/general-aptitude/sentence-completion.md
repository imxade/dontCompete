**Sentence Completion**
=======================

### Introduction

Sentence completion is a type of verbal reasoning question that requires the test-taker to fill in the blanks with the most appropriate word or phrase. This section will cover the theoretical concepts, formulas, and insights required to solve sentence completion questions.

### Core Concepts

*   **Contextual Understanding**: The ability to understand the context in which the sentence is written.
*   **Word Connotations**: The ability to recognize the connotations associated with each word.
*   **Semantic Relationships**: The ability to identify relationships between words and their meanings.

### Key Formulas/Theorems

There are no specific formulas or theorems required for sentence completion. However, understanding the nuances of language and vocabulary is crucial.

### Problem Solving Patterns

To solve sentence completion questions:

1.  Read the sentence carefully and understand the context.
2.  Identify the blanks to be filled and determine the type of word or phrase needed (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).
3.  Analyze the surrounding words and phrases to identify relationships between them.
4.  Choose a word or phrase that fits the context and relationships identified.

### Examples with Solutions

    *   (iii) by: Yoko Roi stands out as an author for standing down as an honorary fellow, after she stood by her writings that stand in freedom of speech.
    *   (iv) in: Yoko Roi stands out as an author for standing down as an honorary fellow, after she stood by her writings that stand in freedom of speech.

2.  **Example:** Seven identical cylindrical chalk-sticks are fitted tightly in a cylindrical container. The length of the container is equal to the length of the chalk-sticks.

    **Solution:**

    Let the length of the container and chalk stick = `l`

    Let the radius of cylinder = `R`

    Let the radius of chalk stick =
