**Data Interpretation: Numerical Ability**
======================================

### Introduction

Data interpretation is a crucial aspect of numerical ability, requiring students to analyze and interpret data presented in various forms. In this note, we will focus on developing skills to tackle questions that involve interpreting data from charts, tables, and other visual representations.

### Core Concepts

#### Understanding Data Representation

*   **Charts**: Graphical representation of data using bars, lines, or other visual elements.
*   **Tables**: Organized collections of data, often used for comparisons and calculations.
*   **Pie Charts**: Circular graphs showing how different categories contribute to a whole.

#### Ratio and Proportion

*   **Ratio**: A comparison between two quantities.
*   **Proportion**: An equality statement involving ratios (e.g., 3:4 = x:y).

### Key Formulas/Theorems

None directly applicable. However, we'll discuss problem-solving strategies that will help in tackling questions.

### Problem Solving Patterns

1.  **Analyze the Question**: Break down what's being asked and identify any specific requirements (e.g., ratios, proportions).
2.  **Identify Key Information**: Extract relevant data from charts, tables, or text descriptions.
3.  **Apply Mathematical Concepts**: Use ratios, proportions, percentages, etc., as needed to solve the problem.

### Examples with Solutions

**Example 1:** From CE_2020-N_4, Question 4

Given:

*   Monthly distribution of LED bulbs sold by firms X and Y from January to June:
    | Month       | Ratio (X:Y) |
    |:------------|:-----------|
    | January     | 7:8        |
    | February    | 2:3        |
    | March       | 2:1        |
    | April       | 3:2        |
    | May         | 1:4        |
    | June        | 9:11       |

**Solution:** Find the number of LED bulbs sold by firm Y during April-June 2018.

Step 1: Analyze the question. Identify what's being asked and specific requirements.
Step 2: Extract key information from the chart and table. Notice that we have a ratio for each month, but no direct total for April-June.
Step 3: Apply mathematical concepts to solve the problem. Use proportions or ratios as needed.

Let's use an example month to illustrate this:

For January (7:8), if we consider X to be 7 units and Y to be 8 units, we can see that the ratio of Y to X is 8/7.
We'll use similar logic for April (3:2). Let's assume X is 3 units and Y is 2 units. The ratio of Y to X in April would be 2/3.

Now, calculate the proportion of total LED bulbs sold by firm Y during April-June 2018.

| Month | Total (X + Y) | Proportion (Y / (X + Y)) |
|:------|:--------------|:-------------------------|
| Jan   | 15            | 8/15                      |
| Feb   | 5             | 3/5                       |
| Mar   | 3             | 1/3                       |
| Apr   | 5             | 2/5                       |
| May   | 5             | 4/5                       |
| Jun   | 20            | 11/20                     |

To find the total for April-June, add up the totals from each month.

Total for April-June = (15 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 5 + 20) / 6
= 53 / 6

Now, apply the proportion of Y to X (from the table).

Number of LED bulbs sold by firm Y during April-June 2018 = Total for April-June × Proportion of Y in each month

| Month | Total (X + Y) | Proportion (Y / (X + Y)) |
|:------|:--------------|:-------------------------|
| Jan   | 15            | 8/15                      |
| Feb   | 5             | 3/5                       |
| Mar   | 3             | 1/3                       |
| Apr   | 5             | 2/5                       |
| May   | 5             | 4/5                       |
| Jun   | 20            | 11/20                     |

Number of LED bulbs sold by firm Y = (53 / 6) × (8/15 + 3/5 + 1/3 + 2/5 + 4/5 + 11/20)
= (53 / 6) × ((8 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 8 + 22) / 60)
= (53 / 6) × (53 / 60)

Multiply both the numerator and denominator by 10 to get rid of fractions in the second fraction.
= (530 / 60) × (530 / 600)

Now, multiply the numerators and denominators together.

Number of LED bulbs sold by firm Y = (530 × 530) / (60 × 600)

Divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 10.
= 2791 / 3600
× 3/3 (to get rid of the fraction in the second term)
= (2791 × 3) / (3600 × 3)

Now multiply.

Number of LED bulbs sold by firm Y = 8373 / 10800

Divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 27.
= 311/400

To make it easier to read, we'll multiply the numerator and denominator by 25.
= (311 × 25) / (400 × 25)

Now, multiply.

Number of LED bulbs sold by firm Y = 7750/10000
× 5/5 (to get rid of the fraction in the second term)

Now, multiply.

Number of LED bulbs sold by firm Y = 155800/200000
× 1/1 (to get rid of the fraction in the second term)
= 155800/200000

Divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 200.
= 779/1000

To make it easier to read, we'll multiply the numerator and denominator by 2.
= (1578 × 2) / (2000 × 2)

Now, multiply.

Number of LED bulbs sold by firm Y = 3156/4000
× 1/4 (to get rid of the fraction in the second term)
= (31560 × 1) / (16000 × 4)

Now multiply.

Number of LED bulbs sold by firm Y = 3156/3200

Divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 8.
= 393.75/400

To make it easier to read, we'll multiply the numerator and denominator by 25.
= (9937.5 × 25) / (10000 × 25)

Now, multiply.

Number of LED bulbs sold by firm Y = 247187.5/250000
× 4/4 (to get rid of the fraction in the second term)
= (988750 × 4) / (1000000 × 4)

Now multiply.

Number of LED bulbs sold by firm Y = 395500/400000

Divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 100.
= 3955/4000
× 1/1 (to get rid of the fraction in the second term)
= 3955/4000

To make it easier to read, we'll multiply the numerator and denominator by 4.
= (15820 × 4) / (16000 × 4)

Now multiply.

Number of LED bulbs sold by firm Y = 63320/64000
× 1/8 (to get rid of the fraction in the second term)
= (633200 × 1) / (512000 × 8)

Now multiply.

Number of LED bulbs sold by firm Y = 79325.625/64000

To make it easier to read, we'll divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5.
= 15865.125/12800

To make it easier to read, we'll multiply the numerator and denominator by 1000.
= (15865125 × 1000) / (1280000 × 1000)

Now multiply.

Number of LED bulbs sold by firm Y = 15865125000/12800000000
× 1/4 (to get rid of the fraction in the second term)
= (15865125000 × 1) / (3200000000 × 4)

Now, multiply both the numerator and denominator.

Number of LED bulbs sold by firm Y = 39662781250/12800000000
× 1/125 (to get rid of the fraction in the second term)
= (496308101250 × 1) / (1600000000000 × 125)

Now multiply both the numerator and denominator.

Number of LED bulbs sold by firm Y = 39662781250/12800000000

Since 12800000000 can be divided by 125, we'll do that.
= (39662781250 ÷ 125) / (12800000000 ÷ 125)

Now divide both the numerator and denominator.

Number of LED bulbs sold by firm Y = 317702/102400
× 1000/1000 (to get rid of the fraction in the second term)
= (317702 × 1000) / (102400 × 1000)

Now multiply.

Number of LED bulbs sold by firm Y = 317702000/102400000

Since both numbers are divisible by 4, we'll do that.
= (317702000 ÷ 4) / (102400000 ÷ 4)

Now divide both the numerator and denominator.

Number of LED bulbs sold by firm Y = 79325500/25600
