**Bending Moment and Shear Force in Statically Determinate Beams**
===========================================================

### Introduction
-----------------

Bending moment and shear force are fundamental concepts in solid mechanics, particularly when analyzing statically determinate beams. These quantities help determine the stresses within a beam subjected to external loads.

### Core Concepts
-----------------

*   **Statically Determinate Beam**: A beam that can be fully described by its geometry and loading conditions, with no indeterminacy.
*   **Bending Moment (BM)**: The moment of a force about a point or axis, causing the beam to bend. Measured in units of length \* force, such as Nm or kNm.
*   **Shear Force (SF)**: The component of a force that causes the beam to deform by sliding along a plane parallel to its neutral axis.

### Key Formulas/Theorems
---------------------------

The maximum bending moment in a simply supported beam with uniformly distributed load is given by:

$$ M_{max} = \frac{wL^2}{8} $$

where $ w $ is the load intensity and $ L $ is the length of the beam.

For a point load $ P $ at distance $ d $ from one end, the maximum bending moment is:

$$ M_{max} = Pd $$

The shear force at any section of a simply supported beam with uniformly distributed load is given by:

$$ V(x) = \frac{w}{2}(L - x) $$

where $ x $ is the distance from the point where the reaction force is applied.

### Problem Solving Patterns
-----------------------------

1.  **Sketch the loading diagram**: Visualize the external loads and reactions on the beam.
2.  **Determine the maximum bending moment**: Use the appropriate formula based on the type of load (uniformly distributed, point load, etc.).
3.  **Find the shear force at a section**: Apply the equation for uniformly distributed load or use the free-body diagram method.

### Examples with Solutions
---------------------------

**Example 1: Uniformly Distributed Load**

A simply supported beam has a length of $ L = 8m $ and is subjected to a uniformly distributed load of $ w = 12kN/m $. Find the maximum bending moment.

$$ M_{max} = \frac{wL^2}{8} = \frac{(12)(8)^2}{8} = 96 kNm $$

**Example 2: Point Load**

A point load of $ P = 10kN $ is applied at a distance of $ d = 3m $ from one end of a simply supported beam. Find the maximum bending moment.

$$ M_{max} = Pd = (10)(3) = 30 kNm $$

### Common Pitfalls
--------------------

1.  **Incorrect application of formulas**: Double-check the units and type of load.
2.  **Miscalculation or incorrect sign**: Verify that the maximum bending moment is positive.

### Quick Summary
------------------

*   Bending moment: $ M = \frac{wL^2}{8} $ for uniformly distributed load, $ M = Pd $ for point load
*   Shear force: $ V(x) = \frac{w}{2}(L - x) $ for uniformly distributed load
