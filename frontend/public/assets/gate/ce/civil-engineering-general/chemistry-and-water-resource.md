**Chemistry and Water Resource**
==============================

### Introduction
-----------------

Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding various aspects of water resources, including treatment, quality assessment, and management. This note covers key concepts related to chemistry and water resource, focusing on principles that appear in GATE Civil Engineering exams.

### Core Concepts
------------------

#### Water Hardness
-------------------

*   Total hardness is the sum of calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions expressed as CaCO3.
    *   $Total \, hardness = [Ca^{2+}] + [Mg^{2+}]\left(\frac{40}{12.1}\right)$
    *   $=[Ca^{2+}]+[Mg^{2+}]\left(3.32\right)$

#### Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)
-------------------------------------

*   BOD is the amount of oxygen consumed by microorganisms to break down organic matter.
*   Ultimate BOD = $\frac{1}{k_{BOD}} \times [S_0]$ where $[S_0]$ is the initial substrate concentration and k_BOD is the BOD rate constant.

#### Sedimentation
-----------------

*   In sedimentation basins, water flows over a settling area, allowing particles to settle.
*   The capacity of the basin can be determined using the formula: Area = Flow Rate $\times$ Time

### Key Formulas/Theorems
---------------------------

*   Water hardness (in mg/L): $Total \, hardness = 3.32 \times ([Ca^{2+}] + [Mg^{2+}])$
*   BOD rate constant at 0°C: $k_{BOD} = \frac{1}{10^{\left(-\frac{T-20}{5.64}\right)}}$
*   Sedimentation basin capacity: Area = Flow Rate $\times$ Time

### Problem Solving Patterns
---------------------------

#### Water Hardness
-------------------

*   To calculate total hardness, use the formula: $Total \, hardness = 3.32 \times ([Ca^{2+}] + [Mg^{2+}])$
*   Consider atomic weights for Ca and Mg when converting to mg/L.

#### BOD
------------

*   Ultimate BOD can be calculated using the formula: Ultimate BOD = $\frac{1}{k_{BOD}} \times [S_0]$
*   Use the BOD rate constant at 0°C: $k_{BOD} = \frac{1}{10^{\left(-\frac{T-20}{5.64}\right)}}$

#### Sedimentation
-----------------

*   Calculate the capacity of the sedimentation basin using: Area = Flow Rate $\times$ Time

### Examples with Solutions
-----------------------------

#### Example 1: Water Hardness

A water sample has a calcium concentration of 200 mg/L and magnesium concentration of 150 mg/L. What is the total hardness?

*   Using the formula: $Total \, hardness = 3.32 \times ([Ca^{2+}] + [Mg^{2+}])$
    *   $= 3.32 \times (200 + 150)$
    *   $= 3.32 \times 350 = 1162$ mg/L

#### Example 2: BOD

A sewage sample has an initial substrate concentration of 1000 mg/L and a BOD rate constant at 0°C is 0.23 d^(-1). What is the ultimate BOD?

*   Using the formula: Ultimate BOD = $\frac{1}{k_{BOD}} \times [S_0]$
    *   $= \frac{1}{0.23} \times 1000$
    *   $= 4348$ mg/L

#### Example 3: Sedimentation

A sedimentation basin has a flow rate of 0.4 m^3/s and an area of 200 m^2. What is the capacity of the basin?

*   Using the formula: Area = Flow Rate $\times$ Time
    *   $Capacity = 0.4 \times 200 = 80$ m^3

### Common Pitfalls
-------------------

*   When calculating water hardness, ensure to use the correct atomic weights for Ca and Mg.
*   When solving BOD problems, remember to use the BOD rate constant at 0°C.

### Quick Summary
-----------------

*   Water Hardness: $Total \, hardness = 3.32 \times ([Ca^{2+}] + [Mg^{2+}])$
*   BOD: Ultimate BOD = $\frac{1}{k_{BOD}} \times [S_0]$
*   Sedimentation Basin Capacity: Area = Flow Rate $\times$ Time
