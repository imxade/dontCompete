**Geomatics Engineering: Theodolites and Plane Table Surveying**
===========================================================

**Introduction**
---------------

Theodolites and plane table surveying are fundamental tools in geomatics engineering for measuring distances, angles, and coordinates of terrestrial objects. A theodolite is an optical instrument used to measure vertical and horizontal angles between two points on the Earth's surface, while a plane table is a graphical tool for recording observations and measurements.

**Core Concepts**
----------------

### Theodolites

A transit theodolite consists of several key components:

*   **Line of Collimation (LC):** The line connecting the object glass to the center of the telescope. It must be perpendicular to the horizontal axis at its intersection with the vertical axis.
*   **Axis of Altitude Level:** The axis that measures the vertical angle between the object and the instrument.
*   **Axis of Plate Level:** The axis that measures the horizontal angle between the object and the instrument.

### Plane Table Surveying

Plane table surveying involves recording observations and measurements on a graph paper with a set of concentric circles. The process includes:

1.  **Setting up the plane table:** Ensuring the horizontal surface is level and the vertical axis is plumb.
2.  **Measuring angles:** Using the theodolite to measure the horizontal and vertical angles between two points.
3.  **Recording measurements:** Tracing the measurements onto the graph paper.

**Key Formulas/Theorems**
-------------------------

### Theodolites

*   **The line of collimation (LC) must be perpendicular to the horizontal axis at its intersection with the vertical axis:**

    $$
    LC \perp Horizontal\ Axis
    $$

*   **The axis of altitude level must be perpendicular to the line of collimation:**

    $$
    Altitude\ Level \perp LC
    $$

### Plane Table Surveying

*   **The plane table is a graphical tool for recording observations and measurements:**


**Problem Solving Patterns**
---------------------------

1.  **Identifying the type of problem:** Determining whether it's related to theodolites or plane table surveying.
2.  **Understanding the instruments:** Familiarizing yourself with the key components of the theodolite and the process of plane table surveying.

**Examples with Solutions**
---------------------------

### Example 1

A transit theodolite is set up on a horizontal surface. The line of collimation (LC) intersects the vertical axis at an angle of 45°. What is the relationship between the LC and the horizontal axis?

Solution:

Using the formula $$
LC \perp Horizontal\ Axis
$$


### Example 2

A plane table surveyor records measurements on a graph paper with concentric circles. The horizontal surface is level, and the vertical axis is plumb. What is the next step in the process?

Solution:

Measuring angles using the theodolite to determine the horizontal and vertical angles between two points.

**Common Pitfalls**
------------------

*   Failing to understand the key components of a transit theodolite.
*   Misinterpreting the relationship between the line of collimation and the horizontal axis.
*   Skipping essential steps in plane table surveying, such as setting up the plane table or recording measurements.
