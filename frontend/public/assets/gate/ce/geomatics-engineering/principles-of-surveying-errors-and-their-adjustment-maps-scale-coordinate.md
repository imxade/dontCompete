**Principles of Surveying Errors and their Adjustment Maps Scale Coordinate**
====================================================================

**Introduction**
---------------

Surveying errors can significantly impact the accuracy of surveying results. Understanding the principles of surveying errors and how to adjust for them is crucial in geomatics engineering. This note will cover the core concepts, key formulas, problem-solving patterns, examples with solutions, common pitfalls, and a quick summary.

**Core Concepts**
----------------

### 1. Types of Surveying Errors

Surveying errors can be categorized into two types:

*   **Gross Errors**: These are large errors that can significantly impact the accuracy of surveying results.
*   **Random Errors**: These are small, unpredictable errors that can accumulate over time.

### 2. Causes of Surveying Errors

Common causes of surveying errors include:

*   **Instrumental errors**: Errors due to faulty or poorly maintained surveying instruments.
*   **Human errors**: Errors caused by human mistakes, such as misreading measurements or incorrect calculations.
*   **Environmental factors**: Weather conditions, topography, and other environmental factors that can affect surveying results.

### 3. Principles of Surveying

The basic principle of surveying is to work from whole to parts. This means starting with a broad overview of the area being surveyed and gradually increasing the level of detail as needed.

**Key Formulas/Theorems**
-------------------------

### 1. Formula for Calculating Scale Factor

The scale factor (SF) is calculated using the formula:

$$ SF = \frac{Scale}{Map\ Scale} $$

where Scale is the scale of the map and Map Scale is the scale of the surveying results.

### 2. Theorem on Contour Intersection

In the case of an overhanging cliff, contours of different elevations may intersect each other.

**Problem Solving Patterns**
---------------------------

When solving problems related to surveying errors and their adjustment, follow these steps:

1.  Identify the type of error (gross or random) and its cause.
2.  Calculate the scale factor using the formula above.
3.  Adjust the map scale accordingly.
4.  Present the results in a clear and concise manner.

**Examples with Solutions**
---------------------------

### Example 1

A surveyor is measuring the area of a field using a planimeter. The planimeter reads 5000 sq.m, but the actual area is 5200 sq.m. What is the scale factor?

Solution:

Using the formula above, we get:

$$ SF = \frac{Scale}{Map\ Scale} $$

$$ SF = \frac{1:10000}{1:5000} $$

$$ SF = 2 $$

### Example 2

A cliff has a height of 10m. The contour map shows the elevation at this point to be 5m. What is the scale factor?

Solution:

Since the contours intersect, we can use the theorem on contour intersection.

The scale factor is not affected by the intersection of contours in this case.

**Common Pitfalls**
-------------------

*   Failing to identify the type of error (gross or random) and its cause.
*   Not calculating the scale factor correctly.
*   Not adjusting the map scale accordingly.

**Quick Summary**
-----------------

*   Surveying errors can be categorized into gross and random errors.
*   Causes of surveying errors include instrumental, human, and environmental factors.
*   The basic principle of surveying is to work from whole to parts.
*   The scale factor is calculated using the formula SF = Scale/Map Scale.
*   Contours of different elevations may intersect each other in case of an overhanging cliff.
