**Water Quality Standards - Physical, Chemical, and Biological Parameters**
===========================================================

### Introduction

Water quality standards are established to ensure that water meets certain criteria for human consumption, industrial use, or environmental protection. These parameters include physical, chemical, and biological characteristics that affect the suitability of water for various purposes.

### Core Concepts

#### 1. Physical Parameters

*   **pH**: Measure of acidity/basicity
*   **Temperature**: Affects microbial growth and chemical reactions
*   **Turbidity**: Measures suspended solids and clarity
*   **Color**: Can indicate presence of certain compounds or organic matter

#### 2. Chemical Parameters

*   **Dissolved Oxygen (DO)**: Essential for aquatic life, especially in rivers and streams
*   **Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)**: Measures organic material's impact on DO
*   **Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)**: Estimates total oxygen required to oxidize all organic matter
*   **Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)**: Inorganic compounds, minerals, or salts dissolved in water

#### 3. Biological Parameters

*   **Microbial Parameters**: Coliform bacteria, E. coli, Salmonella, etc.
*   **Nutrients**: Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels
*   **Algal Blooms**: Excessive growth of algae, potentially toxic to humans and wildlife

### Key Formulas/Theorems

**LaTeX**

*   **pH Calculation:** pH = -log[H+]
*   **Dissolved Oxygen (DO) Formula:**
    \[ DO\left(\frac{mg}{L}\right) = 14.3A_{w}^2e^{-0.0666(100-T)} \]
    where:
        *   A<sub>w</sub> is the water's alkalinity in mg/L as CaCO<sub>3</sub>
        *   T is the temperature of the water in °C
*   **Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) Formula:**
    \[ BOD = K_{d}C^{n} \]
    where:
        *   C is the concentration of organic matter
        *   n and K<sub>d</sub> are empirical constants

### Problem Solving Patterns

**Example 1:** Given a water sample with pH 7.5, DO 8 mg/L, BOD 20 mg/L, and TDS 500 mg/L, determine if it meets the standards for drinking water.

**Solution:**

*   Calculate alkalinity using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation
    \[ A_{w} = \frac{0.05}{\left(1+10^{\text{pH}-14}\right)} \]
    where pH is the calculated value of 7.5.
*   Use the DO formula to determine if the oxygen level meets standards.

### Examples with Solutions

**Example 2:** A water treatment plant discharges wastewater containing 50 mg/L BOD, and a river has a flow rate of 100 m<sup>3</sup>/s. If the plant treats 10% of the total waste, what is the percentage reduction in BOD?

**Solution:**

*   Use the BOD formula to calculate the concentration of organic matter.
*   Apply the dilution equation to determine the overall BOD reduction.

### Common Pitfalls

*   Failing to consider temperature when calculating DO or pH
*   Misapplying chemical formulas or constants (e.g., using the incorrect K<sub>d</sub> value)
*   Neglecting the impact of microorganisms on water quality

### Quick Summary

*   Physical parameters: pH, temperature, turbidity, color
*   Chemical parameters: DO, BOD, COD, TDS
*   Biological parameters: microbial counts, nutrient levels, algal blooms
*   Key formulas:
    *   pH calculation
    *   DO formula
    *   BOD formula
