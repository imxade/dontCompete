**Sentence Completion**
=======================

**Introduction**
---------------

Sentence completion is a type of verbal ability question that requires the test-taker to fill in the blanks with the most suitable word or phrase. This section covers the theoretical concepts and techniques required to tackle such questions.

**Core Concepts**
-----------------

The key concept underlying sentence completion is understanding the relationships between words, phrases, and clauses within a sentence. The test-taker must analyze the context, identify the meaning of each blank, and choose the most appropriate word or phrase that completes the sentence correctly.

### Identifying Relationships

To solve sentence completion questions, one needs to:

* Identify the relationship between the words or phrases in the blanks
* Determine the grammatical function of each blank (e.g., verb, noun, adjective)
* Understand the meaning of each word or phrase and how it relates to the context

**Key Formulas/Theorems**

None directly applicable.

**Problem Solving Patterns**
---------------------------

### Pattern 1: Verb Conjugation

When filling in a blank that requires a verb conjugation (e.g., "he/she/it"), choose the correct form of the verb that agrees with the subject.

Example:

"The dog ____________ (run) quickly."

Answer: runs (subject-verb agreement)

### Pattern 2: Idiomatic Expressions

Be aware of idiomatic expressions and phrasal verbs, which can change the meaning of a sentence significantly.

Example:

"She ____________ (get up) early to catch the train."

Answer: got up (idiomatic expression)

**Examples with Solutions**
---------------------------

### Example 1
Q: "The new employee was expected to ____________ (improve) her skills quickly."

A: improve

Explanation:
* The blank requires a verb conjugation in the active voice.
* The correct form of the verb is "improve" (subject-verb agreement).

### Example 2
Q: "The teacher asked the students to ____________ (write) their essays by tomorrow morning."

A: write

Explanation:
* The blank requires a verb conjugation in the imperative mood.
* The correct form of the verb is "write" (imperative mood).

**Common Pitfalls**
-------------------

### Overlooking Contextual Clues

Do not neglect to analyze the surrounding context and word relationships.

Example:

"The new policy ____________ (help) improve customer satisfaction."

Answer: will help (future tense, subject-verb agreement)

Explanation:
* The blank requires a verb conjugation in the future tense.
* The correct form of the verb is "will help" (subject-verb agreement).

### Ignoring Word Relationships

Be aware of word relationships and idiomatic expressions.

Example:

"The tourists ____________ (get) lost in the city."

Answer: got

Explanation:
* The blank requires a verb conjugation in the past tense.
* The correct form of the verb is "got" (idiomatic expression).

**Quick Summary**
------------------

* Analyze context and word relationships
* Identify relationships between words or phrases
* Determine grammatical function of each blank
* Be aware of idiomatic expressions and phrasal verbs
