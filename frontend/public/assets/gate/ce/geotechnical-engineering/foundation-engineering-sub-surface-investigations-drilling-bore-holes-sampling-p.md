**Geotechnical Engineering: Foundation and Soil Mechanics**
===========================================================

### Introduction
-----------------

Geotechnical engineering is a branch of civil engineering that deals with the study of soil mechanics and rock mechanics. It involves understanding the properties of soils and rocks to design safe and stable foundations for structures, such as buildings, bridges, and dams.

### Core Concepts
------------------

#### Subsurface Investigations
Subsurface investigations involve collecting data about the subsurface conditions at a construction site. This includes drilling boreholes, sampling soil and rock, and conducting in-situ tests.

*   **Drilling Bore Holes**: Drilling boreholes is a method of obtaining information about the subsurface conditions.
*   **Sampling Soil/Rock**: Sampling soil or rock involves collecting small amounts of material for testing and analysis.
*   **In-Situ Tests**: In-situ tests involve conducting tests on soil or rock in place, rather than in a laboratory.

#### Standard Penetration Test (SPT)
The standard penetration test is a field test used to determine the density of soil. It involves driving a split-barrel sampler into the ground and measuring the resistance to penetration.

*   **Split-Barrel Sampler**: The split-barrel sampler is a tool used to collect soil samples.
*   **Resistance to Penetration**: The resistance to penetration is measured in blows per foot (BPF).

#### Cone Penetration Test (CPT)
The cone penetration test is another field test used to determine the properties of soil. It involves pushing a conical penetrometer into the ground and measuring the resistance to penetration.

*   **Conical Penetrometer**: The conical penetrometer is a tool used to measure the properties of soil.
*   **Resistance to Penetration**: The resistance to penetration is measured in terms of the cone tip resistance and the sleeve friction.

#### Plate Load Test
The plate load test is a field test used to determine the bearing capacity of soil. It involves loading a steel plate on top of the soil and measuring the settlement and pressure.

*   **Steel Plate**: The steel plate is loaded on top of the soil to measure its bearing capacity.
*   **Settlement**: The settlement is measured in terms of the movement of the steel plate under load.
*   **Pressure**: The pressure is measured in terms of the force applied to the steel plate.

### Key Formulas/Theorems
------------------------------

#### Rankine's Earth Pressure Theory
Rankine's earth pressure theory is a method used to calculate the earth pressure on retaining walls. It involves considering the friction between the soil and the wall.

*   **Earth Pressure**: The earth pressure is calculated as the sum of the active and passive pressures.
*   **Active Pressure**: The active pressure is the pressure exerted by the soil on the wall when it is in motion.
*   **Passive Pressure**: The passive pressure is the pressure exerted by the soil on the wall when it is at rest.

LaTeX Code:
```latex
\text{Earth Pressure} = \text{Active Pressure} + \text{Passive Pressure}
```

#### Coulomb's Earth Pressure Theory
Coulomb's earth pressure theory is another method used to calculate the earth pressure on retaining walls. It involves considering the friction between the soil and the wall.

*   **Earth Pressure**: The earth pressure is calculated as the sum of the active and passive pressures.
*   **Active Pressure**: The active pressure is the pressure exerted by the soil on the wall when it is in motion.
*   **Passive Pressure**: The passive pressure is the pressure exerted by the soil on the wall when it is at rest.

LaTeX Code:
```latex
\text{Earth Pressure} = \text{Active Pressure} + \text{Passive Pressure}
```

#### Bishop's Method for Stability of Slopes
Bishop's method is a method used to calculate the stability of slopes. It involves considering the moment and force equilibrium of the slope.

*   **Moment Equilibrium**: The moment equilibrium is calculated as the sum of the moments about the base of the slope.
*   **Force Equilibrium**: The force equilibrium is calculated as the sum of the forces acting on the slope.

LaTeX Code:
```latex
\text{Moment Equilibrium:} \sum M = 0
\text{Force Equilibrium:} \sum F = 0
```

### Problem Solving Patterns
------------------------------

#### Stability of Slopes
To determine the stability of slopes, we need to calculate the factor of safety. The factor of safety is calculated as the ratio of the resisting force to the driving force.

*   **Resisting Force**: The resisting force is calculated as the sum of the cohesion and friction.
*   **Driving Force**: The driving force is calculated as the weight of the slope.

LaTeX Code:
```latex
\text{Factor of Safety} = \frac{\text{Resisting Force}}{\text{Driving Force}}
```

#### Earth Pressure on Retaining Walls
To determine the earth pressure on retaining walls, we need to calculate the active and passive pressures. The active pressure is calculated as the sum of the normal and frictional forces.

*   **Normal Forces**: The normal forces are calculated as the product of the unit weight of soil and the area of the wall.
*   **Frictional Forces**: The frictional forces are calculated as the product of the coefficient of friction and the normal forces.

LaTeX Code:
```latex
\text{Active Pressure} = \text{Normal Force} + \text{Frictional Force}
```

### Examples with Solutions
------------------------------

#### Example 1: Stability of Slopes

A slope has a height of 10 m and an angle of repose of 30°. The unit weight of soil is 18 kN/m³, the cohesion is 20 kPa, and the friction angle is 25°.

To calculate the factor of safety:

LaTeX Code:
```latex
\text{Resisting Force} = \text{Cohesion} + \text{Friction}
\text{Driving Force} = \text{Weight of Slope}
\text{Factor of Safety} = \frac{\text{Resisting Force}}{\text{Driving Force}}
```

Solution:

*   Resisting Force = 20 kPa + (18 kN/m³ x tan(25°)) = 30.2 kPa
*   Driving Force = (18 kN/m³ x 10 m) x sin(30°) = 90 kPa
*   Factor of Safety = 30.2 kPa / 90 kPa = 0.34

#### Example 2: Earth Pressure on Retaining Walls

A retaining wall has a height of 5 m and an angle of repose of 45°. The unit weight of soil is 20 kN/m³, the normal force is 50 kN/m², and the frictional force is 10 kN/m².

To calculate the earth pressure:

LaTeX Code:
```latex
\text{Active Pressure} = \text{Normal Force} + \text{Frictional Force}
```

Solution:

*   Active Pressure = 50 kN/m² + 10 kN/m² = 60 kN/m²

### Common Pitfalls
---------------------

#### Stability of Slopes

*   **Ignoring cohesion**: Do not ignore the cohesion when calculating the resisting force.
*   **Incorrect calculation of driving force**: Ensure that you calculate the driving force correctly, taking into account the weight of the slope.

LaTeX Code:
```latex
\text{Driving Force} = \text{Weight of Slope}
```

#### Earth Pressure on Retaining Walls

*   **Ignoring frictional forces**: Do not ignore the frictional forces when calculating the active pressure.
*   **Incorrect calculation of normal forces**: Ensure that you calculate the normal forces correctly, taking into account the unit weight of soil and the area of the wall.

LaTeX Code:
```latex
\text{Normal Force} = \text{Unit Weight of Soil} \times \text{Area of Wall}
```
