The empty weight of the crucible \nis 54.352 g. The crucible with the sample is dried in a hot air oven at \n0\n104 C\n till a constant weight of\n55.129g. Thereafter, the crucible with the dried sample is fired at \n0\n600 C\nfor 1 h in a muffle furnace, and \nthe weight of the crucible along with residue is determined as 54.783 g.
