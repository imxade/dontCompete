  "question_text": "Question 17\nAn unsupported slope of height 15 m is shown in the figure (not to scale), in which the slope face makes \nan angle 50\n\u02da\n with the horizontal. The slope material comprises purely cohesive soil having undrained \ncohesion 75 kPa. A trial slip circle KLM, with a radius 25 m, passes through the crest and toe of the slope \nand it subtends an angle 60\n\u02da\n at its center O. The weight of the active soil mass (W, Bounded by KLMN) \nis 2500 kN/m, which is acting at a horizontal distance of 10 m from the toe of the slope.
