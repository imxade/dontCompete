If force \nP\n is sufficiently \nlarge, then the block \nN\n can be raised. The weights of the wedge and the block are negligible compared to \nthe forces \nP\n and \nQ\n. The coefficient of friction (\n\u03bc\n ) along the inclined surface between the wedges and the\nblock is 0.2. All other surface are frictionless.
