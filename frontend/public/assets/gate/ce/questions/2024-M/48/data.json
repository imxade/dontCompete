  "question_text": "Question 48 \n[Environmental Engineering : Treatment of Water]\n \n \nA \n2m\n2m\n\uf0b4\n tank of \n3m\nheight has inflow, outflow and stirring mechanisms.  Initially, the tank was half-\nfilled with fresh water.  At \n0\nt\n \uf03d\n, an inflow of a salt solution of concentration \n3\n5g / m\n  at the rate of 2 litre/s\nand an outflow of the well stirred mixture at the rate of 1 litre/s are initiated.  This process can be modelled \nusing the following differential equation :\n0.01\n6000\ndm\nm\ndt\nt\n\uf02b\n\uf03d\n\uf02b\nWhere \nm\nis the mass (grams) of the salt at time \nt\n  (seconds).  The mass of the salt (in grams) in the tank \nat 75% of its capacity is __________  \n \n(rounded off to 2 decimal places). \nAns. 24.50 to 25.50",
