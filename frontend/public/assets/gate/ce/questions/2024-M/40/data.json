The polar moments of inertia of the portions \nPQ\n and \nQR\n  of the shaft with\ncircular cross-sections are \n1\nJ\n  and \n2\nJ\n , respectively.  The torsional moment reactions at the supports \nP\nand \nR\n  are \nP\nT\n  and \nR\nT\n , respectively.\n(Figure Not to scale)\nIf \n/\n4\nP\nR\nT\nT\n \uf03d\n and \n1\n2\n/\n2\nJ\nJ\n \uf03d\n, the ratio of the lengths \n1\n2\n/\nL\nL\n is\n(A) 0.50 \n(B) 0.25 \n \n(C) 4.00 \n(D) 2.00 \nAns.
