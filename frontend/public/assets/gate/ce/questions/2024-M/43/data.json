  "question_text": "Question 43 \n \n \n[Environmental Engineering : Air Pollution]\n\nPAGE\n34\n\nFor assessing the compliance with the emissions standards of incineration plants, a correction needs to be \napplied to the measured concentrations of air pollutants.  The emission standard (based on 11% Oxygen)\nfor HCl is 50 \n3\nmg / Nm\n  and the measured concentrations of HCl and Oxygen in flue gas are \n3\n42mg / Nm\nand \n13%\n , respectively. \n \nAssuming 21% Oxygen in air, the CORRECT statement is : \n \n(A) No compliance, as the corrected HCl emission is greater than the emission standard. \n \n(B) Compliance is there, as the corrected HCl emission is lesser than the emission standard. \n \n(C) Compliance is there, as there is no need to apply the correction since Oxygen is greater than 11%\nand HCl emission is lesser than the emission standard. \n \n(D) No compliance, as the Oxygen is greater than 11% in the flue gas. \nAns. (A)",
