Upon hearing a loud \nnoise, the bird flies parallel to the ground surface and reaches a point \nQ\n  which is located at a height of 3\nm above MSL.  The ground surface has a falling gradient of 1 in 2.  Ignoring the effects of curvature and \nrefraction, the horizontal distance (in meters) between points \nP\n  and \nQ\n  is _________ (in integer).",
