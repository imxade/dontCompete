  "explanation_text": "Sol. \nWhile removing the props, we need to\n \nensure that the beam type does not change i.e., if it is a cantilever \nbeam then the props shall be removed in such a manner that the beam at the intermediate stage also shows \ncantilever behavior. \n \nIf we remove prop \u2018S1\u2019 first then tensile stress will be generated at the bottom and no structural \nreinforcement is there to take care of this tension. \n \nSo, correct order is \nS5\nS4\nS3\nS2\nS1\n\uf0ae\n\uf0ae\n\uf0ae\n\uf0ae\n\nPAGE\n13\n\nHence, the correct option is (B). \nQuestion 18 \n \n[Geotechnical Engineering : Shallow Foundation] \n \nA 2 m wide strip footing is founded at a depth of 1.5 m below the ground level in a homogeneous pure \nclay bed.
