  "question_text": "Question 34 \n[Geotechnical Engineering : Origin of Soil & Their Properties]\nAn embankment is constructed with soil by maintaining the degree of saturation as 75% during \ncompaction.  The specific gravity of soil is 2.68 and the moisture content is 17% during compaction.\nConsider the unit weight of water as \n3\n10 kN / m\n .  The dry unit weight (in \n3\nkN / m\n ) of the compacted soil\nis ________ (rounded off to 2 decimal places). \nAns. 16.60 to 16.80",
