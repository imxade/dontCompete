  "question_text": "Question 49 \n \n[Structural Analysis : Analysis of Trusses] \n \nThe plane truss shown in the figure has 13 joints and 22 members.  The truss is made of a homogenous, \nprismatic, linearly elastic material.  All members have identical axial rigidity.  \nA\n  to \nM\n indicate the joints \nof the truss.  The truss has pin supports at joints \nA\n  and \nL\n  and roller support at joint \nK\n .  The truss is\n\nPAGE\n39\n\nsubjected to a \n10kN\n  vertically downward force at joint \nH\n  and a \n10kN\n horizontal force in the rightward\ndirection at joint \nB\n  as shown.\n(Figure Not to scale) \n \nThe magnitude of the reaction (in kN) at the pin support \nL\n is ________ (rounded off to 1 decimal place). \nAns. 7.0 to 8.0",
