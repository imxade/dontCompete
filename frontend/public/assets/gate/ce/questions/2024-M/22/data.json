  "question_text": "Question 22 \n[Transportation Engineering : Geometrical Design of Highway]\n \n \n \nA car is travelling at a speed of 60 km/hr on a section of a National Highway having a downward gradient \nof 2%. The driver of the car suddenly observes a stopped vehicle on the car path at a distance 130 m ahead, \nand applies brake. If the brake efficiency is 60%, coefficient of friction is 0.7, driver\u2019s reaction time is 2.5\ns, and acceleration due to gravity is \n2\n9.81 m/s ,\n the distance (in meters) required by the driver to bring the\ncar to a safe stop lies in the range\n(A) 126 to 130 \n(B) 41 to 45\n(C) 33 to 37 \n(D) 75 to 79 \nAns. (D)",
