  "question_text": "Question 12\n \n \nA grit chamber of rectangular cross-section is to be designed to remove particles with diameter of 0.25 \nmm and specific gravity of 2.70. The terminal settling velocity of the particles is estimated as 2.5 cm/s. \nThe chamber is having a width of 0.50 m and has to carry a peak wastewater flow of 9720 m\n3\n/d giving \nthe depth of flow as 0.75 m. If a flow-through velocity of 0.3 m/s has to be maintained using a \nproportional weir at the outlet end of the chamber, the minimum length of the chamber (in m, in \ninteger) to remove 0.25 mm particles completely is ______.  \nAns. \n9 \nSol.\n \nGiven : \n \n \nGrit chamber  \n \nDiameter of particle to be removed, \n0.25 mm\nd\n =\n \n \nSpecific gravity, \n2.7\nG\n =\n \n \nVelocity of particles, \n2.5 cm/s\ns\nV\n =\nWidth of chamber, \n0.5 m\nB\n =\nWaste water of flow, \n3\n9720 m /d\nQ\n =\nDepth of flow, \n0.75 m\nY\n =\n\u2234\n  Plan area \nDischarge ( )\nVelocity (\n)\ns\nQ\nV\n=\nQ\nB\nL\nV\n\u00d7\n=\n\ns\n4\n10\n9720 86400\n0.5\n2.5\nL\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n=\n\n900 cm\n9 m\nL\n =\n=\n \n \nMinimum length of chamber required to remove 0.25 diameter particle is 9 m. \nQuestion 13\n \n \nRelationship between traffic speed and density is described using a negatively sloped straight line.
