After primary clarifier, the ultimate BOD of the influent, which enters into ASP reactor is \n200 mg/L Treated effluent after secondary clarifier is required to have an ultimate BOD of 20 mg/L. \nMix liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) concentration in the reactor and the under flow is \nmaintained as 3000 mg/L and  12000 mg/L, respectively.  The hydraulic retention time and mean sale \ncell residence time are 0.2 day and 10 days, respectively.
