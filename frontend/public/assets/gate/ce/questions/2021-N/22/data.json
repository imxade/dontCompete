The depth of the filter bed is 0.70 m and the porosity is 0.35. The filter \nbed is to be expanded to a porosity of 0.65 by hydraulic backwash. If the terminal settling velocity of \nsand particles during backwash is 4.5 cm/s, the required backwash velocity is\n(A) \n0.75 cm/s\n  \n(B) \n0.69 cm/s\n  \n(C) \n3\n6.35 10\nm/s\n\u2212\n\u00d7\n \n(D) \n3\n5.79 10\nm/s\n\u2212\n\u00d7",
