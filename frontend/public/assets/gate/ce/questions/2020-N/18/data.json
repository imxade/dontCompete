The \noedometer\u2019s deflection gauge indicates a reading of 2.1 mm, just before removal of the load, without \nallowing any swelling. The void ratio is 0.62 at this stage. The initial void ratio (\nround off to two decimal \nplaces\n) of the standard specimen is _________. \nAns. \n0.8213 \nQuestion 20 \n \nA gas contains two types of suspended particles having average sizes of \n2 \u03bcm\n and\n \n50 \u03bcm.\nAmongst the\noptions given below, the most suitable pollution control strategy for removal of these particles is \n \n(A) electrostatic precipitator followed by venture scrubber \n \n(B) bag filter followed by electrostatic precipitator \n \n(C) settling chamber followed by bag filter \n \n(D) electrostatic precipitator followed by cyclonic separator \nAns. \n(C) \nQuestion 21\nA soil has dry unit weight of \n3\n15.5 kN/m ,\n specific gravity of 2.65 and degree of saturation of 72%.\nConsidering the unit weight of water as \n3\n10 kN/m ,\n the water content of the soil (\nin %, round off to two\ndecimal places\n) is _________. \nAns. \n19.28 \nQuestion 22 \n \nA fair (unbiased) coin is tossed 15 times.
