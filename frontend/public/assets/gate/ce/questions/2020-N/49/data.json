The saturated unit weight and cohesion of clay are\n3\n18kN/m\n  and 20 kPa, respectively. The angle of internal friction of clay is zero. In order to prevent\ndevelopment of tension zone, the height of the wall is required to be increased. Dry sand is used as backfill \nabove the clay for the increased portion of the wall. The unit weight and angle of internal friction of sand\nare \n3\n16kN/m\n and \n0\n30\n , respectively. Assume that the back of the wall is smooth and top of the backfill is\nhorizontal.
