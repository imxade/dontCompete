Burning rate is 1000 tonnes/d .Oxygen in air by \nweight is 23%. Assume complete conversion of Carbon to \n2\nCO\n , Hydrogen to \n2\nH O\n , Sulphur to \n2\nSO\n  and\nNitrogen to \n2\nNO\nGiven Atomic weight: H = 1, C = 12, N = 14, O = 16, S = 32\nThe stoichiometric (theoretical) amount of air (in tonnes/d\n, round off to the nearest integer\n) required for \ncomplete burning of this waste, is ______.",
