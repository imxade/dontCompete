  "question_text": "Question 42 \n[Environmental Engineering : Treatment of Water] \n \nA hypothetical multimedia filter, consisting of anthracite particles (specific gravity: 1.50), silica sand \n(specific gravity: 2.60), and ilmenite sand (specific gravity: 4.20), is to be designed for treating \nwater/wastewater. After backwashing, the particles should settle forming three layers: coarse anthracite \nparticles at the top of the bed, silica sand in the middle, and small ilmenite sand particles at the bottom of \nthe bed. \n \nAssume\n\nPAGE\n35\n\n(i)  \nSlow discrete settling (Stoke\u2019s law is applicable) \n \n(ii)  All particles are spherical \n \n(iii)  Diameter of silica sand particles is 0.20 mm \n \nThe CORRECT option fulfilling the diameter requirements for this filter media is  \n \n(A) diameter of anthracite particles is slightly less than 0.35 mm and diameter of ilmenite particles is\nslightly greater than 0.141 mm \n \n(B) diameter of anthracite particles is slightly greater than 0.35 mm and diameter of ilmenite particles is\nslightly less than 0.141 mm \n \n(C) diameter of anthracite particles is slightly less than 0.64 mm and diameter of ilmenite particles is\nslightly less than 0.10 mm \n \n(D) diameter of anthracite particles is slightly greater than 0.64 mm and diameter of ilmenite particles is\nslightly less than 0.10 mm \nAns.\n \n(A)",
