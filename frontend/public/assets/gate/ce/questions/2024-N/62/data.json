However, a few years after construction, \nthe Railway Authorities decided to run express trains on this track. The maximum allowable cant \ndeficiency is 10 cm. \n \nThe maximum restricted speed (in kmph) of the express trains running on this track is _______________ \n(rounded off to the nearest integer). \nAns. 112 to 116",
