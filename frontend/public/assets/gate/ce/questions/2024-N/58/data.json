The \norifice is plugged and the tank is filled up to 5 m height. Consider the average value of discharge \ncoefficient as 0.6 and acceleration due to gravity (g) as\n2\n10 m/s\n . After unplugging the orifice, the time (in \nseconds) taken for the water level to drop from 5 m to 3.5 m under free discharge condition is \n____________ (rounded off to 2 decimal places). \nAns. 102.00 to 106.00",
