  "answer_text": "(A)",
  "explanation_text": "Sol. \nIn working stress method, safety is accounted for by considering factor of safety in material strength only \nand no factor is considered in load.\nHence, the correct option is (A). \n \nQuestion 22 \n[Geotechnical Engineering : Compressibility & Consolidation]\n \n \nThe contact pressure distribution shown in the figure belongs to a\n(A) rigid footing resting on a cohesionless soil. \n \n(B) rigid footing resting on a cohesive soil. \n \n(C) flexible footing resting on a cohesionless soil. \n \n(D) flexible footing resting on a cohesive soil. \nAns.\n \n(B)\nSol. \n1.
