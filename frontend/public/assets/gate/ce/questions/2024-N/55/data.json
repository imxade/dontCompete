  "question_text": "Question 55 \n[Geotechnical Engineering : Shear Strength of Soil] \n \nA drained triaxial test was conducted on a saturated sand specimen using a stress-path triaxial testing \nsystem. The specimen failed when the axial stress reached a value of \n2\n100 kN/m\n  from an initial confining\npressure of \n2\n300 kN/m\n . The angle of shearing plane (in degrees) with respect to horizontal is \n________________ (rounded off to the nearest integer). \nAns. 30 to 30",
