  "question_text": "Question 36 \n[Engineering Mathematics : Probability & Statistics] \n \nIn a sample of 100 heart patients, each patient has 80% chance of having a heart attack without medicine \nX. It is clinically known that medicine X reduces the probability of having a heart attack by 50%. Medicine \nX is taken by 50 of these 100 patients. The probability that a randomly selected patient, out of the 100 \npatients, takes medicine X and has a heart attack is \n \n(A) 40% \n(B) 60% \n \n(C) 20% \n(D) 30% \nAns.\n \n(C)",
