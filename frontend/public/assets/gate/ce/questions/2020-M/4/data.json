  "question_text": "Question 4\nA road in a hilly terrain is to be laid at a gradient of 4.5%. A horizontal curve of radius 100 m is laid at a \nlocation on this road. Gradient needs to be eased due to combination of curved horizontal and vertical \nprofiles of the road. As per IRC, the compensated gradient (\nin %, round off to one decimal place\n), is \n_______.",
