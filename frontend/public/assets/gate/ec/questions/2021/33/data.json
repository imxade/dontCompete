  "explanation_text": "Sol.\n \nGiven :\nAddressing of memory = \n32 K 16\n\u00d7\nAddressing of memory = \n5\n10\n2\n2\n16\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n \n \n10\n(\n2 )\nK\n =\n\uf051\nAddressing of memory = \n15\n2\n16\n\u00d7\nSo \n32 K 16\n\u00d7\n memory needs 15 address lines\nSo it will need decoder of size \n15\n15 2\n\u00d7\n, which will need \n15\n2\n  AND gates.\nHence, the correct option is (C)."
