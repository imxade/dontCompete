  "question_text": "Question 39 \n \n \n \n  \nCommunications System (2M)\nA message signal having peak-to-peak value of 2 V, root mean square value of 0.1 V and bandwidth of 5 \nkHz is sampled and fed to a pulse code modulation (PCM) system that uses a uniform quantizer. The PCM \noutput is transmitted over a channel that can support a maximum transmission rate of 50 kbps. Assuming \nthat the quantization error is uniformly distributed, the maximum signal to quantization noise ratio that \ncan be obtained by the PCM system (rounded off to two decimal places) is ______.",
