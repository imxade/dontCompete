**Transformation of Shape**
=========================

### Introduction

The transformation of shape refers to the process of changing the appearance or dimensions of an object or figure without altering its inherent properties. In the context of spatial aptitude, transformations are crucial for understanding how shapes can be manipulated and analyzed.

### Core Concepts

*   **Translations**: A translation is a type of transformation that involves moving an object from one location to another without rotating or scaling it.
*   **Rotations**: A rotation is a transformation that turns an object around a fixed point or axis by a specified angle. There are three types of rotations:
    *   **Clockwise Rotation** : 360° clockwise
    *   **Counter-Clockwise Rotation** : 360° counter-clockwise
    *   **Half Turn**: A rotation of 180° about the center
*   **Scaling**: Scaling is a transformation that changes the size of an object by a specified factor. There are two types of scaling:
    *   **Enlargement** (or Expansion): Increasing the size of an object
    *   **Reduction** (or Contraction): Decreasing the size of an object

### Key Formulas/Theorems

*   **Translation**: No specific formula is required for translation as it involves moving an object without changing its dimensions or orientation.
*   **Rotation**: The center of rotation remains unchanged during a rotation. 
*   **Scaling**:
    *   **Enlargement (Expansion)**: New Length = Original Length \* Scale Factor
    *   **Reduction (Contraction)**: New Length = Original Length / Scale Factor

### Problem Solving Patterns

When dealing with transformations, it is essential to identify the type of transformation and understand its effects on the object. Here are some problem-solving strategies:

1.  **Identify the Type of Transformation**: Determine whether the transformation involves translation, rotation, or scaling.
2.  **Understand the Effects**: Analyze how each type of transformation affects the object's dimensions, orientation, or position.
3.  **Apply Mathematical Formulas**: Use relevant formulas to calculate new dimensions or positions.

### Examples with Solutions

1.  **Example 1**:
    *   A square is translated 5 units to the right and 3 units upwards.
    *   The original square has side length = 4 units.
    *   What are the new coordinates of the square?
    
    Solution: 
    New x-coordinate = Original x-coordinate + Translation in x-direction
                    = Original x-coordinate + 5 units
    
    New y-coordinate = Original y-coordinate + Translation in y-direction
                    = Original y-coordinate + 3 units

2.  **Example 2**:
    *   A circle is rotated 90° counter-clockwise about its center.
    *   The original circle has a radius of 6 units.
    *   What are the new dimensions (radius and diameter) after rotation?
    
    Solution: 
    Radius remains unchanged during rotation.
    
    Diameter = 2 \* Radius

### Common Pitfalls

*   **Misidentifying Transformation Types**: Be cautious when identifying translations, rotations, or scaling. Make sure to understand their effects on the object's dimensions and orientation.
*   **Incorrect Application of Formulas**: Double-check mathematical calculations for accuracy.

### Quick Summary

Here's a brief summary of key concepts:

*   Translations: Moving an object without rotation or scaling
*   Rotations: Turning an object around a fixed point by a specified angle (clockwise, counter-clockwise, half turn)
*   Scaling: Changing the size of an object by a specified factor (enlargement, reduction)

Transformations are crucial in understanding how shapes can be manipulated and analyzed. By mastering these concepts and applying them to real-world problems, you'll become proficient in solving spatial aptitude questions.
