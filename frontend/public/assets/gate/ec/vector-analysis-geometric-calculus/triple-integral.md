**Triple Integral**
====================

**Introduction**
---------------

The triple integral is a fundamental concept in Vector Analysis and Geometric Calculus, extending the notion of double integrals to three dimensions. It's used to find the volume under a surface or the mass of an object with density varying over its region.

**Core Concepts**
-----------------

* **Volume Element**: In 3D space, the volume element is given by $dxdydz$, which represents an infinitesimally small cube.
* **Triple Integral Notation**: The triple integral of a function $f(x,y,z)$ over a solid region $S$ is written as $\iiint_S f(x,y,z) dV = \iiint_S f(x,y,z) dxdydz$.
