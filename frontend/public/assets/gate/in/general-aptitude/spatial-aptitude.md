**Spatial Aptitude**
=====================

### Introduction
-----------------

Spatial aptitude refers to the ability to reason about shapes, patterns, and spatial relationships. It involves understanding how objects fit together, move, or transform within a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space. Spatial reasoning is an essential skill in various fields, including architecture, engineering, computer graphics, and more.

### Core Concepts
-----------------

*   **Symmetry**: Symmetry occurs when a shape has the same appearance on either side of a line, axis, or point. There are several types of symmetry, including:
    *   **Line symmetry** (or reflection symmetry): A line that divides the shape into two identical parts.
    *   **Rotation symmetry**: A rotation around a central point by a fixed angle that results in the same appearance.
    *   **Point symmetry**: A point from which the shape can be rotated to match its original appearance.
*   **Geometric Transformations**: Geometric transformations involve moving, rotating, or scaling shapes. These include:
    *   **Translation**: Moving a shape by a fixed distance along a straight line.
    *   **Rotation**: Rotating a shape around a central point by a fixed angle.
    *   **Scaling**: Enlarging or shrinking a shape by a fixed factor.

### Key Formulas/Theorems
-------------------------

*   **Properties of Regular Polygons**:
    $$
    \text{Number of sides} = n \\
    \text{Measure of each interior angle} = \frac{(n - 2) \times 180}{n}
    $$

### Problem Solving Patterns
---------------------------

1.  **Analyzing Shapes**: Carefully examine the given shape to identify symmetries, geometric transformations, and patterns.
2.  **Breaking Down Complex Problems**: Divide complex problems into smaller, manageable parts by identifying key elements such as line symmetry, rotation symmetry, or point symmetry.

### Examples with Solutions
---------------------------

**Example:**

A regular hexagon has six equal sides. If one side is extended to form a new angle, what will be the measure of this new angle?

**Solution:** Using the formula for the interior angle of a regular polygon:

$$
\text{Measure of each interior angle} = \frac{(6 - 2) \times 180}{6}
= \frac{4 \times 180}{6}
= 120^{\circ}
$$

Since we're extending one side to form a new angle, the new angle will be half the measure of an interior angle.

$$
\text{New angle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 120^{\circ} = 60^{\circ}
$$

### Common Pitfalls
-------------------

*   **Misinterpreting Symmetry**: Be careful not to confuse line symmetry with rotation symmetry or point symmetry.
*   **Oversimplifying Complex Problems**: Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.

### Quick Summary
------------------

*   Symmetry:
    *   Line symmetry (reflection)
    *   Rotation symmetry
    *   Point symmetry
*   Geometric Transformations:
    *   Translation

    *   Scaling
*   Properties of Regular Polygons:
    $$
    \text{Number of sides} = n \\
    \text{Measure of each interior angle} = \frac{(n - 2) \times 180}{n}
    $$
