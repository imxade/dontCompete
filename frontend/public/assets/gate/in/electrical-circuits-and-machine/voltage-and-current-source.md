**Voltage and Current Source**
==========================

**Introduction**
---------------

In this section, we will cover the fundamental concepts of voltage and current sources in electrical circuits. Understanding these concepts is crucial for analyzing and designing complex electronic systems.

**Core Concepts**
-----------------

### Voltage Sources

A voltage source is a device that provides a constant voltage across its terminals. It can be thought of as a "black box" that supplies energy to a circuit. The key characteristics of a voltage source are:

*   **Voltage**: The voltage provided by the source, measured in volts (V).
*   **Current**: The current drawn from the source, measured in amperes (A).

### Current Sources

A current source is a device that provides a constant current through its terminals. It can also be thought of as a "black box" that supplies energy to a circuit.

**Key Formulas/Theorems**
-------------------------

*   **Ohm's Law**: $V = IR$ (Volts = Amps × Ohms)
*   **Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)**: The sum of currents entering a node is equal to the sum of currents leaving the node.
*   **Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)**: The sum of voltage changes around a loop is zero.

**Problem Solving Patterns**
---------------------------

When analyzing circuits with voltage and current sources, follow these steps:

1.  Identify the type of source (voltage or current).
2.  Determine the relevant equations to use (Ohm's Law, KCL, or KVL).
3.  Apply the chosen equation(s) to solve for unknown quantities.

**Examples with Solutions**
---------------------------

### Example 1

A voltage source supplies a circuit with $V = 10 \text{ V}$ and $R = 5 \Omega$. What is the current drawn from the source?

```latex
I = \frac{V}{R} = \frac{10 \text{ V}}{5 \Omega} = 2 \text{ A}
```

### Example 2

A current source supplies a circuit with $I = 0.5 \text{ A}$ and $R = 10 \Omega$. What is the voltage across the resistor?

```latex
V = IR = (0.5 \text{ A})(10 \Omega) = 5 \text{ V}
```

**Common Pitfalls**
------------------

*   Failing to identify the type of source.
*   Applying the wrong equation(s).
*   Neglecting to consider the internal resistance of a voltage or current source.

**Quick Summary**
-----------------

*   Voltage sources provide constant voltage across their terminals.
*   Current sources provide constant current through their terminals.
*   Ohm's Law, KCL, and KVL are essential for analyzing circuits with voltage and current sources.
