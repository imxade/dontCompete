(D) \nSol. \nResidency is a famous housing complex with many well-established individuals among its residents. A \nrecent survey conducted among the residents of the complex revealed that all of those residents who are \nwell established in their respective fields happen to be academicians. From this information we can \neasily inferred that \u201cSome academicians residing in the complex are well established in their fields\u201d \noption (D) is correct.   \n \nOption (C) cannot be inferred with certainty as it is not a necessary condition some residents who are \nestablished in their field cannot be the authors of any book.  \n \nOption (B) can also not be inferred as it is clearly mention in the passage, all those residents who are \nwell established in their respective field are academicians and vice-versa cannot be certainly inferred. \n \nOption (A) can also not be inferred as \u201csome authors of bestselling books are residents of the complex \nwho are wells established in their fields.\u201d Are academicians which is not mention in option.  \n \nHence, the correct option is (D).\n \nQuestion 7 \n \nAnkita has to climb 5 stairs starting at the ground, while respecting the following rules : \n \n1. \nAt any stage, Ankita can move either one or two stairs up. \n \n2. \nAt any stage, Ankita cannot move to a lower step. \n \nLet \n( )\nF N\n  denote the number of possible ways in which Ankita can reach the \nN\nth \nstair.\nFor example, \n(1)\n1, (2)\n2, (3)\n3.\nF\nF\nF\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\nThe value of \n(5)\nF\n is _______. \n \n \n(A) 8 \n(B) 7  \n \n(C) 6 \n(D) 5 \nAns. (A) \nQuestion 8 \n \nThe information contained in DNA is used to synthesize proteins that are necessary for the functioning \nof life. DNA is composed of four nucleotides: Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), and Guanine \n(G). The information contained in DNA can then be thought of as a sequence of these four nucleotides: \nA, T, C, and G. DNA has coding and non-coding regions. Coding regions where the sequence of these \nnucleotides are read in groups of three to produce individual amino acids\u2014constitute only about 2% of \nhuman DNA. For example, the triplet of nucleotides CCG codes for the amino acid glycine, while the \ntriplet GGA codes for the amino acid proline. Multiple amino acids are then assembled to form a \nprotein. \n \nBased only on the information provided above, which of the following statements can be logically \ninferred with certainty? \n \n(i) \nThe majority of human DNA has no role in the synthesis of proteins. \n \n(ii) The function of about 98% of human DNA is not understood. \n \n(A) only (i) \n(B) only (ii) \n \n(C) both (i) and (ii) \n(D) neither (i) nor (ii) \nAns.
