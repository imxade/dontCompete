**Magnetic Circuit**
=====================

### Introduction
-----------------

A magnetic circuit is a network of magnetic components such as inductors, transformers, and coils that interact with each other through magnetic fields. Understanding magnetic circuits is crucial for analyzing complex electrical systems and designing efficient power transfer devices.

### Core Concepts
-------------------

#### Inductance

Inductance ($L$) is the property of a conductor or circuit to oppose changes in current flow through it. It is measured in Henrys (H). The self-inductance of an inductor depends on its geometry, material, and configuration.

#### Mutual Inductance

Mutual inductance ($M$) occurs when two or more circuits are coupled together, allowing the magnetic field generated by one circuit to induce a current in another. The mutual inductance between two circuits is given by:

$$M = KL_1L_2$$

where $K$ is the coupling coefficient.

#### Coupling Coefficient

The coupling coefficient ($K$) is a dimensionless quantity that represents the efficiency of energy transfer between two coupled circuits. It ranges from 0 (no coupling) to 1 (maximum coupling).

### Key Formulas/Theorems
---------------------------

*   Energy stored in an inductor:

$$E = \frac{1}{2}LI^2$$

*   Mutual inductance:

$$M = KL_1L_2$$

*   Voltage across a coupled circuit:

$$V = M\frac{dI_1}{dt} + L\frac{dI}{dt}$$

### Problem Solving Patterns
---------------------------

When analyzing magnetic circuits, follow these steps:

1.  Identify the components involved (inductors, transformers, coils).
2.  Determine the coupling between the circuits.
3.  Calculate mutual inductance and energy transfer.
4.  Apply Kirchhoff's laws to solve for currents and voltages.

### Examples with Solutions
---------------------------

**Example 1:**

A sinusoidal current of $i(t) = \sin(200\pi t)$ mA flows through a 4 H inductor, which is mutually coupled to another 5 H inductor carrying $i(t) = 2\sin(200\pi t)$ mA. The coupling coefficient between the inductors is 0.6.

Find the peak energy stored in the circuit:

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Inductor 1] --> B[Mutual Inductance]
B --> C[Inductor 2]
D[Coupling Coefficient] --> E[K = 0.6]
F[L_1 = 4 H, L_2 = 5 H] --> G[M = K * L_1 * L_2]
H[G] --> I[E = (1/2) * M * (dI/dt)^2]
```

Solution:

Given:
$K = 0.6$
$L_1 = 4 H, L_2 = 5 H$

Mutual inductance $M = KL_1L_2 = 0.6 \times 4 \times 5 = 12 H$

Peak value of current: $I_{max} = I_0 = \frac{2}{\pi} A$

Energy stored:

$E_{peak} = (1/2)M(I_{max}/\omega)^2 = (1/2)(12)(2/\pi)^2(200\pi)^2 J$

Simplify:

$E_{peak} = 173.7 J$

### Common Pitfalls
-------------------

*   Forgetting to account for mutual inductance and coupling coefficients.
*   Incorrectly applying Kirchhoff's laws or energy conservation principles.

### Quick Summary
------------------

*   Magnetic circuits involve coupled inductors, transformers, and coils.
*   Mutual inductance ($M$) depends on coupling coefficient ($K$) and self-inductances ($L_1$, $L_2$).
*   Energy transfer between coupled circuits is crucial for designing efficient power transfer devices.
