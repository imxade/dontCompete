**Hall Effect Sensor Theory Note**
=====================================

### Introduction

The Hall effect sensor is a crucial component in various electronic systems, including instrumentation engineering. It measures the magnetic field strength by generating a voltage across the device due to the current flowing through it and the external magnetic field.

### Core Concepts

The Hall effect was first discovered by Edwin H. Hall in 1879. The phenomenon occurs when a current-carrying conductor is placed perpendicular to a magnetic field, resulting in a potential difference (voltage) between two points on the conductor.

**Hall Effect Principle**

When a current $I$ flows through a conductor and a magnetic field $B$ is applied perpendicularly, the Lorentz force acts on the free electrons in the conductor. This force causes the electrons to deflect towards one side of the conductor, creating an imbalance in charge distribution. As a result, an electric field $E$ is generated across the conductor, perpendicular to both $I$ and $B$. The direction of $E$ can be determined using the right-hand rule.

### Key Formulas/Theorems

The Hall voltage $V_H$ generated by the sensor is directly proportional to both the current flowing through it $I$ and the magnetic flux density $B$, as per the following formula:

$$V_H = \frac{IB}{nqt}$$

where:
- $V_H$ is the Hall voltage
- $I$ is the current flowing through the conductor
- $B$ is the magnetic flux density perpendicular to the direction of current
- $n$ is the number of charge carriers (electrons) per unit volume
- $q$ is the elementary charge
- $t$ is the thickness of the conductor

### Problem Solving Patterns

*   Analyze the orientation of the magnetic field and the current flow.
*   Determine the direction of the Hall voltage using the right-hand rule.
*   Use the formula for the Hall voltage to calculate its magnitude.

### Examples with Solutions

**Example 1**

A Hall effect sensor has a current flowing through it of $5$ A. The magnetic flux density is $0.2$ T. If the number of charge carriers per unit volume is $10^{26}$ m$^{-3}$, the thickness of the conductor is $1$ mm, and the elementary charge is $1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ C, what is the Hall voltage generated?

**Solution**

Using the formula for the Hall voltage:

$$V_H = \frac{IB}{nqt}$$

Substituting the given values:

$$V_H = \frac{(5\text{ A})(0.2\text{ T})}{(10^{26}\text{ m}^{-3})(1.6 \times 10^{-19}\text{ C})(1 \times 10^{-3}\text{ m})}$$

Simplifying:

$$V_H = 6.25 \times 10^{-4}\text{ V}$$

### Common Pitfalls

*   Confusing the direction of the Hall voltage with the magnetic field.
*   Incorrectly applying the formula for the Hall voltage.

### Quick Summary

*   The Hall effect occurs when a current-carrying conductor is placed perpendicular to a magnetic field.
*   The Hall voltage is directly proportional to both the current and the magnetic flux density.
*   The direction of the Hall voltage can be determined using the right-hand rule.
