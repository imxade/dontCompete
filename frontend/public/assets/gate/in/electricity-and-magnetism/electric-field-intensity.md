**Electric Field Intensity**
==========================

### Introduction

The electric field intensity (E) is a measure of the force exerted on a unit charge by an electric field. It's a fundamental concept in electricity and magnetism, crucial for understanding various phenomena such as electrostatics, electromagnetism, and electrical engineering.

### Core Concepts

*   Electric Field: A vector field that represents the force per unit charge at each point in space.
*   Electric Flux: The dot product of the electric field and a surface area vector. It's used to calculate the total electric flux through a closed surface.
*   Gauss's Law: States that the net electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the charge enclosed within it.

### Key Formulas/Theorems

$$\Phi_E = \frac{q_{enclosed}}{\epsilon_0}$$

$$E = \frac{F}{q}$$

$$V = -\int E \cdot dr$$

where:

*   $\Phi_E$ is the electric flux
*   $q_{enclosed}$ is the enclosed charge
*   $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space
*   $E$ is the electric field intensity
*   $F$ is the force on a unit charge
*   $V$ is the electric potential

### Problem Solving Patterns

1.  **Identify charges**: Determine the type and magnitude of charges involved.
2.  **Draw electric field lines**: Visualize the direction and strength of the electric field.
3.  **Apply Gauss's Law**: Use it to calculate electric flux and enclosed charge.
4.  **Calculate electric potential**: Integrate the electric field along a path.

### Examples with Solutions

**Example 1: Electric Field between two charges**

Suppose we have two point charges, $q_1$ and $q_2$, separated by a distance r.

*   Calculate the electric field intensity at a point P due to $q_1$.
*   Apply superposition principle to find the total electric field at P.

Solution:

$$E = k \frac{q}{r^2}$$

**Example 2: Electric Flux through a spherical surface**

A charged sphere has a radius of 5 cm and contains 10 μC of charge. Calculate the electric flux through its surface.

Solution:

$$\Phi_E = \frac{q_{enclosed}}{\epsilon_0}$$

### Common Pitfalls

*   Misapplying Gauss's Law or incorrectly identifying enclosed charges.
*   Forgetting to consider superposition principle when multiple charges are involved.

### Quick Summary

*   Electric field intensity (E) is force per unit charge.
*   Apply Gauss's Law to calculate electric flux and enclosed charge.
*   Use superposition principle for multiple charges.
*   Calculate electric potential by integrating the electric field along a path.
