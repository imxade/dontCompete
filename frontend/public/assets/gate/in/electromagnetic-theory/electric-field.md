**Electric Field**
================

### Introduction
----------------

The electric field is a fundamental concept in electromagnetic theory that describes the force experienced by charged particles in an electric field. It is a vector field, denoted as $\mathbf{E}$, that characterizes the strength and direction of the electric force at each point in space.

### Core Concepts
-----------------

#### Electric Field Lines

*   Electric field lines are imaginary lines that emerge from positive charges and enter negative charges.
*   The density of field lines around a charge is proportional to the magnitude of the charge.
*   Field lines never intersect, as the electric field is a vector field.

#### Coulomb's Law

$F = \frac{k \cdot q_1 \cdot q_2}{r^2}$

where:

*   $k$: Coulomb's constant ($8.99 \times 10^9 N \cdot m^2/C^2$)
*   $q_1$, $q_2$: Magnitudes of the charges
*   $r$: Distance between the charges

#### Electric Field Strength

$\mathbf{E} = \frac{\mathbf{F}}{q}$

where:

*   $\mathbf{E}$: Electric field strength at a point in space
*   $\mathbf{F}$: Electric force on a test charge at that point
*   $q$: Magnitude of the test charge

### Key Formulas/Theorems
-------------------------

#### Electric Field due to a Point Charge

$\mathbf{E} = \frac{k \cdot q}{r^2} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}}$

where:

*   $\mathbf{E}$: Electric field strength at a point in space
*   $k$: Coulomb's constant ($8.99 \times 10^9 N \cdot m^2/C^2$)
*   $q$: Magnitude of the charge
*   $r$: Distance between the charge and the point in space
*   $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$: Unit vector pointing from the charge to the point

#### Electric Field due to a Line Charge

$\mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{2\pi\epsilon_0}\ln\left(\frac{L}{r_\perp}\right) \cdot \hat{\mathbf{z}}$

where:

*   $\mathbf{E}$: Electric field strength at a point in space
*   $\rho$: Linear charge density of the line charge
*   $\epsilon_0$: Vacuum permittivity ($8.85 \times 10^{-12} F/m$)
*   $L$: Length of the line charge
*   $r_\perp$: Perpendicular distance from the line charge to the point

### Problem Solving Patterns
---------------------------

*   When dealing with electric fields due to multiple charges, use superposition principle.
*   Identify the type of charge (positive or negative) and its sign in the equation.
*   Be careful when calculating distances between charges.

### Examples with Solutions
---------------------------

### Example 1:

Find the electric field strength at a point $2 m$ away from a point charge of magnitude $4 \mu C$. The point is on the same axis as the charge.

```latex
\mathbf{E} = \frac{k \cdot q}{r^2} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}}
= \frac{(8.99 \times 10^9) (4 \times 10^{-6})}{(2)^2} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}}
= \frac{35.96 \times 10^{3}}{4}
\approx 8.99 \times 10^{3} N/C
```

### Example 2:

A long, straight wire carries a uniform linear charge density of $2 \mu C/m$. Find the electric field strength at a point $0.1 m$ away from the wire.

```latex
\mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{2\pi\epsilon_0}\ln\left(\frac{L}{r_\perp}\right) \cdot \hat{\mathbf{z}}
= \frac{(2 \times 10^{-6})}{(2\pi)(8.85 \times 10^{-12})} \ln\left(\frac{1}{0.1}\right)
\approx 3.51 \times 10^{4} N/C
```

### Common Pitfalls
------------------

*   Don't forget to include the unit vector in the direction of the electric field.
*   Be careful with signs when dealing with multiple charges.

### Quick Summary
-----------------

*   Electric field is a vector field that characterizes the force experienced by charged particles.
*   Use Coulomb's Law and superposition principle to calculate electric fields due to point or line charges.
*   Pay attention to signs and unit vectors in your calculations.
