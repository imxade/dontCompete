**Interferometry**
================

### Introduction
---------------

Interferometry is a technique used to measure small changes in distance or phase by splitting light into two or more beams that interfere with each other. This concept is crucial in optical instrumentation, particularly in Michelson interferometers.

### Core Concepts
-----------------

#### Principle of Interference
-----------------------------

When two waves overlap, they form an interference pattern. The resulting intensity is given by the square of the sum of the individual wave amplitudes: $I = I_1 + I_2 + 2 \sqrt{I_1 I_2} \cos(\phi)$.

#### Path Difference
-------------------

The path difference between two waves determines the phase shift and, consequently, the interference pattern. In a Michelson interferometer, the movable arm is used to create a variable path difference.

### Key Formulas/Theorems
-------------------------

*   **Path Difference (Δx)**: $2 \mu x = 2 \lambda n$
*   **Fringe Crossing (n)**: $n = \frac{\Delta x}{\lambda}$
*   **Phase Shift ($\phi$)**: $\phi = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} \Delta x$

### Problem Solving Patterns
-----------------------------

1.  Calculate the path difference between two waves.
2.  Determine the number of fringe crossings (n).
3.  Use the formula $n = \frac{\Delta x}{\lambda}$ to find the wavelength ($\lambda$) or other unknowns.

### Examples with Solutions
---------------------------

**Q:** A Michelson interferometer in a vacuum has its movable arm moved by 325 m, resulting in 1000 fringe crossings. Find the wavelength of the laser used (in nanometers).

**Sol:**

1.  Calculate the path difference ($\Delta x$): $\Delta x = 2 \mu x = 2 \times 325 \text{ m} = 650 \text{ m}$.
2.  Determine the number of fringe crossings (n): $n = 1000$
3.  Use the formula $n = \frac{\Delta x}{\lambda}$ to find the wavelength ($\lambda$): $\lambda = \frac{\Delta x}{n} = \frac{650 \text{ m}}{1000} = 0.65 \text{ m}$.
4.  Convert the wavelength from meters to nanometers: $1 \text{ m} = 10^9 \text{ nm}$, so $\lambda = 0.65 \text{ m} \times 10^9 \text{ nm/m} = 650 \text{ nm}$.

### Common Pitfalls
-------------------

*   **Incorrect calculation of path difference**: Make sure to use the correct formula ($2 \mu x$) and units.
*   **Miscalculation of fringe crossings (n)**: Verify that you are using the correct number of fringe crossings (n).
*   **Inconsistent units**: Ensure that all calculations are performed with consistent units (e.g., meters, nanometers).

### Quick Summary
-----------------

*   Interferometry is a technique used to measure small changes in distance or phase.
*   The principle of interference and path difference are crucial concepts.
