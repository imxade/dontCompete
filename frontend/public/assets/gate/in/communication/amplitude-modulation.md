**Amplitude Modulation**
======================

**Introduction**
---------------

Amplitude modulation (AM) is a technique used in communication systems to transmit information by varying the amplitude of a carrier wave. It's an essential concept in telecommunication, and this note will delve into its theory, key formulas, and problem-solving patterns.

**Core Concepts**
-----------------

### What is Amplitude Modulation?

In AM, the original message signal (information-bearing signal) is modified to vary the amplitude (strength or size) of a high-frequency carrier wave. The resulting modulated signal contains both the information-bearing signal and the carrier wave.

### Types of Modulation

There are two types of modulation:

1.  **Amplitude Modulation (AM)**: As described above.
2.  **Frequency Modulation (FM)**: Involves varying the frequency of the carrier wave.

**Key Formulas/Theorems**
-------------------------

### Power Efficiency of AM

The power efficiency of an amplitude modulated signal is given by:

$$\eta = \frac{2μ^2}{1 + μ^2} \times 100\%$$

where $μ$ is the modulation index, which represents the ratio of the maximum value of the modulating signal to the amplitude of the carrier wave.

### Modulation Index

The modulation index is a measure of the extent of modulation. It's defined as:

$$μ = \frac{a_m}{A_c}$$

where $a_m$ is the maximum value of the modulating signal and $A_c$ is the amplitude of the carrier wave.

**Problem Solving Patterns**
---------------------------

When solving problems related to AM, follow these steps:

1.  Identify the modulation index ($μ$) from the given information.
2.  Use the power efficiency formula to calculate the percentage value.
3.  Ensure you round off the result to one decimal place (as specified in the question).

**Examples with Solutions**
---------------------------

### Example 1

Given: $μ = 0.6$, find the power efficiency of the AM scheme.

Solution:

$$\eta = \frac{2(0.6)^2}{1 + (0.6)^2} \times 100\%$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$\eta = \frac{2 \times 0.36}{1 + 0.36} \times 100\%$$

$$= \frac{0.72}{1.36} \times 100\%$$

$$≈ 52.94\%$$

### Example 2

Given: $μ = 0.8$, find the power efficiency of the AM scheme.

Solution:

Using the same formula, we get:

$$\eta = \frac{2(0.8)^2}{1 + (0.8)^2} \times 100\%$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$\eta = \frac{2 \times 0.64}{1 + 0.64} \times 100\%$$

$$= \frac{1.28}{1.64} \times 100\%$$

$$≈ 77.83\%$$

**Common Pitfalls**
-----------------

*   Forgetting to round off the result to one decimal place.
*   Incorrectly applying the power efficiency formula.

**Quick Summary**
----------------

*   Amplitude modulation involves varying the amplitude of a carrier wave.
*   The power efficiency of an AM scheme is given by the formula: $\eta = \frac{2μ^2}{1 + μ^2} \times 100\%$
*   Modulation index ($μ$) represents the ratio of the maximum value of the modulating signal to the amplitude of the carrier wave.
