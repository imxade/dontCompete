**Transistors and Current Gain**
=====================================

**Introduction**
---------------

A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electronic signals. It has three terminals: base (B), collector (C), and emitter (E). The current gain, denoted by β, is a measure of how much the current at the collector is amplified compared to the current at the base.

**Core Concepts**
-----------------

### Transistor Operation

A transistor operates on the principle of charge carrier flow. When a small current flows into the base, it creates an excess of charge carriers in the emitter region. This excess of charge carriers then flows out of the emitter and into the collector, creating a larger current.

### Current Gain (β)

The current gain, β, is defined as the ratio of the collector current to the base current:

$$\beta = \frac{I_C}{I_B}$$

where $I_C$ is the collector current and $I_B$ is the base current.

**Key Formulas/Theorems**
-------------------------

### Current Gain Formula

The current gain formula is:

$$\beta = \frac{\frac{I_C}{V_C}}{\frac{I_B}{V_B}}$$

where $V_C$ is the collector voltage and $V_B$ is the base voltage.

**Problem Solving Patterns**
---------------------------

### Analyzing Transistor Circuits

To solve transistor circuit problems, follow these steps:

1. Identify the type of transistor (NPN or PNP) and its configuration.
2. Determine the current gain, β.
3. Use the current gain formula to calculate the collector current.
4. Apply Kirchhoff's laws to analyze the circuit.

**Examples with Solutions**
---------------------------

### Example 1

A transistor has a current gain of 20. The base current is 5 μA and the collector voltage is 10 V. Calculate the collector current:

$$\beta = \frac{I_C}{I_B} = 20$$
$$I_C = \beta \times I_B = 20 \times 5 μA = 100 μA$$

### Example 2

In the given circuit, all transistors are identical and have a current gain of 20. The base current is 1.25 mA. Calculate the collector current:

$$I_C = \beta \times I_B = 20 \times 1.25 mA = 25 mA$$

**Common Pitfalls**
------------------

### Assuming β is Constant

The current gain, β, may not be constant in all situations. It depends on the transistor type and configuration.

### Neglecting External Factors

External factors such as temperature and voltage can affect the transistor's behavior.
