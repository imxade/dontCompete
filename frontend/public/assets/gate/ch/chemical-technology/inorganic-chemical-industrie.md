**Inorganic Chemical Industry - Ammonia Manufacturing**
=====================================================

**Introduction**
---------------

Ammonia (NH3) is a critical chemical used in various industries, including fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, and power generation. The production of ammonia involves several process units that convert methane into hydrogen, which is then combined with nitrogen to produce ammonia. This theory note will cover the essential concepts and principles involved in the ammonia manufacturing process.

**Core Concepts**
----------------

### Methanation Reaction

The methanator unit is where the conversion of methane (CH4) into hydrogen takes place:

\[ \text{CH}_4 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow 4\text{H}_2 + \text{CO}_2 \]

### CO Shift Conversion

The CO shift convertor unit converts carbon monoxide (CO) into carbon dioxide (CO2):

\[ \text{CO} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2 \]

### Reformer Unit

The reformer unit is responsible for converting methane into hydrogen:

\[ \text{CH}_4 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow 4\text{H}_2 + \text{CO}_2 \]

### Ammonia Synthesis

In the ammonia convertor, nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2) are combined to produce ammonia:

\[ \text{N}_2 + 3\text{H}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{NH}_3 \]

**Key Formulas/Theorems**
------------------------

*   Methanation reaction: $CH_4 + 2H_2O \rightarrow 4H_2 + CO_2$
*   CO shift conversion: $CO + H_2O \rightarrow CO_2 + H_2$
*   Reformer unit: $CH_4 + 2H_2O \rightarrow 4H_2 + CO_2$

**Problem Solving Patterns**
---------------------------

1.  Identify the chemical reactions involved in each process unit.
2.  Determine the correct order of the units based on the reaction sequence.

**Examples with Solutions**

### Example 1

Determine the correct order of the process units:

P: Methanator, Q: CO shift convertor, R: CO2 stripper, S: Reformer, T: Ammonia convertor

Solution:
The correct order is P, Q, R, S, T. The methanator unit converts methane into hydrogen, which is then fed to the reformer unit. The reformer unit produces hydrogen and carbon dioxide, which are then converted to carbon monoxide in the CO shift convertor. Finally, the ammonia convertor combines nitrogen with hydrogen to produce ammonia.

### Example 2

Given the following process units: Methanator (P), CO shift convertor (Q), Reformer (R), Ammonia convertor (T), what is the order of these units?

Solution:
The correct order is R, Q, P, T. The reformer unit converts methane into hydrogen and carbon dioxide, which are then converted to carbon monoxide in the CO shift convertor. The methanator unit converts more methane into hydrogen, which is then fed to the ammonia convertor.

**Common Pitfalls**
-------------------

*   Failing to identify the correct order of process units.
*   Misunderstanding chemical reactions and their sequences.

**Quick Summary**
------------------

*   Ammonia production involves several process units: methanator, CO shift convertor, reformer, and ammonia convertor.
*   Each unit is responsible for converting methane into hydrogen or carbon dioxide.
*   The correct order of the units is determined by the reaction sequence.
