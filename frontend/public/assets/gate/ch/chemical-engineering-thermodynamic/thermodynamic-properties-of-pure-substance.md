**Thermodynamic Properties of Pure Substance**
=============================================

**Introduction**
---------------

This note covers the thermodynamic properties of pure substances, a fundamental concept in chemical engineering. Understanding these principles is crucial for solving problems involving mass transfer, phase equilibria, and chemical reactions.

**Core Concepts**
-----------------

### Thermodynamic Properties

Thermodynamic properties are intensive or extensive physical quantities that describe the state of a system. These include:

* **Temperature (T)**: Measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance.
* **Pressure (P)**: Force exerted per unit area on a surface.
* **Specific Volume (v)**: Volume occupied by a unit mass of a substance.
* **Enthalpy (H)**: Total energy of a system, including internal energy and pressure-volume work.

### Ideal Gas Law

The ideal gas law relates the pressure, volume, and temperature of an ideal gas:

$$PV = nRT \tag{1}$$

where $P$ is pressure, $V$ is volume, $n$ is the number of moles, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is temperature.

### Henry's Law

Henry's law describes the behavior of dissolved gases in a liquid:

$$p_i = k \times x_i \tag{2}$$

where $p_i$ is the partial pressure of the dissolved gas, $k$ is Henry's constant, and $x_i$ is the mole fraction of the dissolved gas.

### Equilibrium Conditions

At equilibrium, the rates of forward and reverse processes are equal. In the context of mass transfer, this means that the rate at which a substance dissolves in a liquid equals the rate at which it escapes into the vapor phase.

**Key Formulas/Theorems**
-------------------------

* **Ideal Gas Law (Equation 1)**: Relates pressure, volume, and temperature of an ideal gas.
* **Henry's Law (Equation 2)**: Describes the behavior of dissolved gases in a liquid.
* **Mole Fraction**: The ratio of the number of moles of a substance to the total number of moles in a mixture.

**Problem Solving Patterns**
---------------------------

1.  Identify the type of problem:
    *   Mass transfer involving ideal solutions or ideal gases.
    *   Equilibrium conditions for dissolved gases in liquids.
2.  Apply relevant thermodynamic principles and laws:
    *   Use Henry's law to determine the partial pressure of a dissolved gas.
    *   Employ the ideal gas law to calculate the volume or temperature of an ideal gas.
3.  Analyze the given data and constraints:
    *   Identify the variables and their relationships.
    *   Determine the conditions for equilibrium.

**Examples with Solutions**
---------------------------

### Example 1: Henry's Law

A container contains water at 290 K and 100 kPa, with air containing 3% CO2 by volume. The liquid phase comprising dissolved CO2 behaves like an ideal solution. Use Henry's constant of CO2 in water at 290 K as 12 MPa.

**Solution**: 

1.  Identify the type of problem: Mass transfer involving an ideal solution.
2.  Apply relevant thermodynamic principles and laws: Henry's law (Equation 2).
3.  Analyze the given data and constraints:
    *   Given values: $p_{CO_2} = 100 kPa$, $x_{CO_2} = 0.03$ (from 3% CO2 by volume), $T = 290 K$, $k = 12 MPa$.
4.  Calculate the partial pressure of CO2 using Henry's law:
    $$p_{CO_2} = k \times x_{CO_2}$$
    $$p_{CO_2} = 12 MPa \times 0.03 = 360 kPa$$

### Example 2: Equilibrium Conditions

Under equilibrium conditions, the mole fraction of CO2 dissolved in water is:

**Solution**: 

1.  Identify the type of problem: Mass transfer involving an ideal solution.
2.  Apply relevant thermodynamic principles and laws:
    *   Henry's law (Equation 2).
3.  Analyze the given data and constraints:
    *   Given values: $p_{CO_2} = 360 kPa$, $k = 12 MPa$.
4.  Calculate the mole fraction of CO2 using Henry's law:
    $$x_{CO_2} = \frac{p_{CO_2}}{k}$$
    $$x_{CO_2} = \frac{360 kPa}{12 MPa} = 0.03$$

**Common Pitfalls**
------------------

*   Failing to apply the correct thermodynamic principles and laws.
*   Incorrectly interpreting the given data and constraints.
*   Overlooking equilibrium conditions.

**Quick Summary**
