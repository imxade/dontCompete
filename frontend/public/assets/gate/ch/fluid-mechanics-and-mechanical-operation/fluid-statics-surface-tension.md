# Fluid Statics and Surface Tension
## Introduction
Fluid statics deals with the behavior of fluids at rest under the influence of gravity, while surface tension refers to the phenomenon where a liquid's surface forms a "film" due to intermolecular forces. These concepts are crucial in various fields like chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, and physics.

## Core Concepts

### Fluid Statics
Fluid statics is based on Archimedes' Principle, which states that the buoyancy force (or upthrust) exerted on an object immersed in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

\[ F_b = \rho V g \]

where $F_b$ is the buoyancy force, $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $V$ is the volume of the displaced fluid, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

### Surface Tension
Surface tension arises from the intermolecular forces between molecules at the surface of a liquid. It can be thought of as a "skin" on the liquid's surface that behaves like an elastic membrane. The surface tension ($\gamma$) can be calculated using the following formula:

\[ \gamma = \frac{\text{force}}{\text{length}} \]

## Key Formulas/Theorems

### Fluid Statics
- Archimedes' Principle: $F_b = \rho V g$
- Buoyancy force: $F_b = F_g - F_p$, where $F_g$ is the weight of the fluid and $F_p$ is the weight of the object.

### Surface Tension

- Laplace's Law: $\Delta P = \frac{2\gamma}{r}$
  \[ \text{where } \Delta P \text{ is the pressure difference across a curved surface,} \]
  \[ \gamma \text{ is the surface tension, and} r \text{ is the radius of curvature.} \]

## Problem Solving Patterns
When dealing with fluid statics and surface tension problems:

1. **Identify the system**: Clearly define the boundaries of the problem.
2. **Determine the forces involved**: Account for gravity, buoyancy, and any external forces.
3. **Apply relevant principles**: Use Archimedes' Principle or Laplace's Law where applicable.

## Examples with Solutions
### Example 1: Buoyancy Force Calculation

A cube (side length = 5 cm) is submerged in water ($\rho = 1000$ kg/m³). Calculate the buoyancy force acting on it.

#### Solution
\[ F_b = \rho V g \]
\[ V = (\text{side})^3 = (0.05)^3 \, \text{m}^3 \]
\[ F_b = 1000 \times 0.000125 \times 9.81 \, \text{N} \]

### Example 2: Surface Tension

A soap film is formed between two rings of radii $r_1$ and $r_2$. Given $\gamma = 30$ mN/m, find the pressure difference across the film if the rings are placed so that $r_1 = 5$ cm and $r_2 = 3$ cm.

#### Solution
\[ \Delta P = \frac{2\gamma}{r} = \frac{2 \times 30 \times 10^{-3}}{\frac{(5 + 3) \times 10^{-2}}{2}} \]

## Common Pitfalls

- Failing to account for buoyancy in submerged objects.
- Misunderstanding the sign of pressure differences across curved surfaces.
