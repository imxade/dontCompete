The following two parallel reactions \noccur.\n4\n2\n2\nCH\nO\nHCHO\nH O\n+\n\u2192\n+\n4\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nCH\nO\nCO\nH O\n+\n\u2192\n+\nMethane and oxygen are fed to the reactor. The product gases leaving the reactor include methane \noxygen, formaldehyde, carbon dioxide and water vapor.\n\nGATE 2021 \n [Forenoon Session]\nChemical Engineering\nPAGE\n14\n\n1\n60 mol s\n\u2212\n of methane enters the reactor. The molar flow rate (in \n1\nmol s )\n\u2212\n of \n4\n2\n,\nCH\nO\n  and \n2\nCO\n  leaving\nthe reactor are 26, 2 and 4 respectively.
