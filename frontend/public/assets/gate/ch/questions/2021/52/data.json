  "question_text": "Question 52\nA binary liquid mixture consists of two species 1 and 2. Let \n\u03b3\n  and \nx\n represent the activity coefficient\nand the mole fraction of the species, respectively. Using a molar excess Gibbs free energy model, In \n1\n\u03b3\nvs.\n1\nx\n  and In \n2\n\u03b3\n  vs.\n1\nx\n  are plotted. A tangent drawn to the In \n1\n\u03b3\n  vs.\n1\nx\n  curve at a mole fraction of \n1\n0.2\nx\n =\nhas a slope \n1.728.\n= \u2212\nThe slope of the tangent drawn to the In \n2\n\u03b3\n  vs.\n1\nx\n  curve at the same mole fraction is _______. (correct to\n3 decimal places)",
