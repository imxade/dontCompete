The corresponding values are \n2\np\n  and \n2\n\u03c0\n  at the permeate side. The membrane,\nfeed, and permeate are at the same temperature. For equilibrium to prevail, the general criterion that \nshould be satisfied is\n(A) \n1\n1\n2\n2\np\np\n+ \u03c0 =\n+ \u03c0\n   \n \n \n(B) \n1\n1\n2\n2\np\np\n\u2212\u03c0 =\n\u2212\u03c0\n(C) \n1\n2\np\np\n=\n  \n \n \n(D) \n1\n2\n\u03c0 = \u03c0",
