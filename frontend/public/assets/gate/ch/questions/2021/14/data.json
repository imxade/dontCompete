Pure gas is used in this stripping operation. All solutions are \ndilute and Henry\u2019s law, \n*\ny\nmx\n=\n, is applicable. Here \n*\ny\n  is the mole fraction of the solute in the gas\nphase in equilibrium with the liquid phase of solute mole fraction \nx \nand \nm\n is the Henry\u2019s law constant.\nLet \n1\nx\n  be the mole fraction of the solute in the leaving liquid and \n2\nx\n  be the mole fraction of solute in the\nentering liquid.\nWhen the value of the ratio of the liquid to gas molar flow rates is equal to \nm\n, the overall liquid phase \nnumber of transfer units.
