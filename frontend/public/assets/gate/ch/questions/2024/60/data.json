A U-tube manometer is connected to measure the pressure drop.  Assume the \ndischarge coefficient is independent of the Reynolds number and geometric ratios.  If the volumetric flow \nrate through the pipe is doubled \n\ud835\udc44\n2\n = 2\ud835\udc44\n1\n, the corresponding ratio of the manometer readings \n\ud835\udee5\n\u210e\n2\n/\ud835\udee5\n\u210e\n1\n, \nrounded off to the nearest integer, is __________.   \n \n \n[Fluid mechanics 2 marks]\n6 cm\nD\n \uf03d\n2 cm\nd\n \uf03d\nwater\nh\n\uf044",
