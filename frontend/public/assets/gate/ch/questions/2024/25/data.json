The facility \nconsists of the following process units \u2013  \n \nP : Methanator, Q: CO shift convertor, R : CO2 stripper, S : Reformer, T: Ammonia convertor \n \nThe correct order of these units, starting from methane feed is \n[Chemical Technology, 1 Marks] \n \n(A) S, Q, R, P, T \n(B)  P, Q, R, S, T \n \n(C) S, P, Q, R, T \n(D)  P, S, T, Q, R  \nAns.
