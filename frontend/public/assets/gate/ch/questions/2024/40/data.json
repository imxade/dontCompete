The desired composition of ethanol in the exit \ngas stream is 0.5 mol%.  the equilibrium mole fraction of ethanol in the gas phase, \n\ud835\udc66\u2217\n, is related to that \nin the liquid phase, \n\ud835\udc65\n, as \n\ud835\udc66\u2217= 2\ud835\udc65\n.  Assume \n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc42\n2\n is insoluble in water and neglect evaporation of water.  \nIf the water flow rate is twice the minimum, the mole fraction of ethanol in the spent water is\n[Mass transfer, 2 Marks]\n \n \n(A) 0.0225 \n(B) 0.0126 \n \n(C) 0.428 \n(D) 0.0316 \nAns. \n(B)",
