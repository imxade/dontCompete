At time \n\ud835\udc61= 0\n, the temperature of the \ntop surface at \n\ud835\udc66= \ud835\udc3b\n1\n is increased to \n\ud835\udc47\n1\n, while the bottom surface at \n\ud835\udc66= 0\n is maintained at \n\ud835\udc47\n0\n for \n\ud835\udc61\u22650\n.  \nAssume heat transfer occurs only in the \n\ud835\udc66\u2212\ndirection, and all thermal properties of the slab are constant.  \nThe time required for the temperature at \n\ud835\udc66= \ud835\udc3b\n1\n/2\n to reach 99% of its final steady value is \n\ud835\udf0f\n1\n.  If the \nthickness of the slab is doubled to \n\ud835\udc3b\n2\n = 2\ud835\udc3b\n1\n, and the time required for the temperature at \n\ud835\udc66= \ud835\udc3b\n2\n/2\n to \nreach 99% of its final steady value is \n\ud835\udf0f\n2\n, then \n\ud835\udf0f\n2\n/\ud835\udf0f\n1\n is\n[Heat transfer, 2 Marks]\n\nPAGE\n32\n\n1\n(A) 2 \n(B)\n4\n1\n(C) 4 \n(D)\n2",
