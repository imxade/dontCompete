Initially, the movable wall is \nheld in place by latches \n\ud835\udc3f\n1\n and \n\ud835\udc3f\n2\n such that the volume of compartment \n\ud835\udc34\n is \n0.1\ud835\udc5a\n3\n.  Compartment \n\ud835\udc34\ncontains a monoatomic ideal gas at 5 bar and 400 K.  compartment \n\ud835\udc35\n is perfectly evacuated and contains \na massless Hookean spring of force constant \n0.3\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5a\n\u22121\n at its equilibrium length (stored elastic energy is \nzero).  The latches \n\ud835\udc3f\n1\n and \n\ud835\udc3f\n2\nare released, the wall moves to the right by 0.2 m, where it is held at the new \nposition by latches \n\ud835\udc3f\n3\n and \n\ud835\udc3f\n4\n.  Assume all the walls and latches are massless.  The final equilibrium \ntemperature, in \n\ud835\udc3e\n, of the gas in compartment \n\ud835\udc34\n, rounded off to 1 decimal place, is _______.\n[Thermodynamics 2 marks]\nL\n3\nL\n1\nCompartment \nA\nCompartment \nB\nL\n2\nL\n4",
