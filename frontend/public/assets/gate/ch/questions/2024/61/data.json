Stages 1 and 2 reject heat at 360 K and 300 K, respectively.  Stage 2 is driven by \nthe heat rejected by Stage 1.  If the overall process efficiency is 50% of the corresponding Carnot \nefficiency, the power delivered by the process, in kW, rounded off to 2 decimal places, is ________.\n[Thermodynamics 2 marks]\n \nAns. 0.24 to 0.26",
