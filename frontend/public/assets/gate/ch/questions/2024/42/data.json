The relative volatility of \n\ud835\udc34\n with \nrespect to \n\ud835\udc35\n is 2.  The steady-state composition of \n\ud835\udc34\n in the vapor leaving the 1\nst\n, 2\nnd\n and 3\nrd\n trays in the \nrectifying section are 94, 90 and 85 mol%, respectively.  for ideal trays and constant molal overflow, the \nreflux-to-distillate ratio is\n[Mass transfer, 2 Marks]\n \n \n(A) 1.9 \n(B) 2.7 \n \n(C) 1.2 \n(D) 1.1 \nAns. \n(B)",
