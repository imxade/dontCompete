The feed flow rate and concentration of \n\ud835\udc34\n to the first reactor are \n10\ud835\udc5a\n3\n\u210e\n\u22121\n and \n1kmol\ud835\udc5a\n\u22123\n, respectively.   At steady-state, the concentration of \n\ud835\udc34\n at the exit of the second \nreactor is \n0.2kmol\ud835\udc5a\n\u22123\n.
