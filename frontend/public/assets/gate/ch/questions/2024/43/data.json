For \nthe first two hours, the measured drying rate is constant at \n2kg\ud835\udc5a\n\u22122\n\u210e\n\u22121\n.  Thereafter, in the falling-rate\n\nPAGE\n37\n\nperiod, the rate decreases linearly with the moisture content.  The equilibrium moisture content is 0.05 kg \nper dry solid and the drying area of the particles is \n0.5\ud835\udc5a\n2\nperkg\ndry solid.
