**Measurement Standard**
=======================

### Introduction

A measurement standard is a system or protocol that enables the transmission of measurement and control signals between devices, ensuring accurate and consistent communication. In instrumentation and process control, standards play a crucial role in maintaining reliability and efficiency.

### Core Concepts

In this context, we will focus on four common standards for transmitting measurement and control signals:

*   **4-20 mA**: This standard uses a current loop to transmit measurements, with 4 mA representing the minimum value and 20 mA representing the maximum.
*   **3-15 psig**: This standard is used for pneumatic transmission of measurements, where 3 psig represents the minimum value and 15 psig represents the maximum.
*   **1-5 VDC**: This standard uses a voltage loop to transmit measurements, with 1 V representing the minimum value and 5 V representing the maximum.

These standards are commonly used in industrial settings due to their simplicity and robustness. However, not all options provided may be applicable or suitable for specific applications.

### Key Formulas/Theorems

No specific formulas or theorems apply directly to measurement standards; however, understanding the principles of signal transmission and control is essential.

### Problem Solving Patterns

When solving questions related to measurement standards:

1.  **Identify the standard**: Determine which standard is being asked about.
2.  **Understand the range**: Familiarize yourself with the minimum and maximum values associated with each standard.
3.  **Eliminate incorrect options**: Use your knowledge of standards to eliminate any clearly incorrect answers.

### Examples with Solutions

**Example:**

Given a measurement device that transmits signals using the 4-20 mA standard, which of the following represents the range of possible values?

(A) 0-100 %
(B) 3-15 psig
(C) 1-5 VDC
(D) 0-10V

**Solution:**

The correct answer is (A) 0-100 %. Since the device uses the 4-20 mA standard, which represents a current range from 4 mA to 20 mA, this corresponds to a percentage range of 0% to 100%.

### Common Pitfalls

*   **Misinterpreting standards**: Be aware of the specific standard being asked about and its associated values.
*   **Not eliminating incorrect options**: Make sure to carefully review each option before selecting an answer.

### Quick Summary

Key concepts:

*   4-20 mA: current loop, minimum value = 4 mA, maximum value = 20 mA
*   3-15 psig: pneumatic transmission, minimum value = 3 psig, maximum value = 15 psig
*   1-5 VDC: voltage loop, minimum value = 1 V, maximum value = 5 V

Common pitfalls:

*   Misinterpreting standards
*   Not eliminating incorrect options
