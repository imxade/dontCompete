**Vapor Liquid Equilibrium (VLE)**
=====================================

### Introduction

In this topic, we will explore the principles of vapor-liquid equilibrium, a fundamental concept in mass transfer. We will derive key formulas and understand problem-solving patterns using the given source question as a reference.

### Core Concepts

#### Raoult's Law

Raoult's law states that the partial pressure of each component in a mixture is proportional to its mole fraction in the liquid phase. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$P_A = x_A \cdot P_A^* \text{ and } P_B = x_B \cdot P_B^*$$

where $P_A$ and $P_B$ are the partial pressures of components A and B, respectively; $x_A$ and $x_B$ are their mole fractions in the liquid phase; and $P_A^*$ and $P_B^*$ are their pure component vapor pressures.

#### Vapor Pressure

Vapor pressure is a measure of the tendency of a substance to evaporate. It depends on temperature, molecular weight, and intermolecular forces.

#### Equilibrium Constant

At equilibrium, the partial pressures of components A and B in the vapor phase are equal to their mole fractions multiplied by their pure component vapor pressures. The equilibrium constant (K) can be expressed as:

$$K = \frac{P_A}{x_A} = \frac{P_B}{x_B}$$

LaTeX:
$\boxed{\text{Equilibrium Constant: } K = \frac{P_A}{x_A} = \frac{P_B}{x_B}}$

### Problem Solving Patterns

When solving VLE problems, follow these steps:

1.  Identify the components and their mole fractions in the liquid phase.
2.  Determine the partial pressures of each component using Raoult's law.
3.  Calculate the equilibrium constant (K) for each component.

**Example: Solution to Source Question**

Q18: A vapor-liquid mixture of components A and B obeys Raoult’s law. The vapour pressure of A is half that of B. The vapour phase concentrations of A and B are $3 \text{ mol}^{-3}$, and $6 \text{ mol}^{-3}$, respectively.

### Problem Solving Steps

1.  Identify the components and their mole fractions in the liquid phase: We assume that the liquid phase has equal molar concentrations for simplicity.
2.  Determine the partial pressures of each component using Raoult’s law:

$$P_A = x_A \cdot P_A^* = (3/10) \cdot (1/2) \text{ atm} = 0.15 \text{ atm}$$

$$P_B = x_B \cdot P_B^* = (7/10) \cdot 1 \text{ atm} = 0.7 \text{ atm}$$
3.  Calculate the equilibrium constant (K) for each component:

$$K_A = \frac{P_A}{x_A} = \frac{0.15}{(3/10)} = 0.5$$

$$K_B = \frac{P_B}{x_B} = \frac{0.7}{(7/10)} = 1.00$$
4.  The ratio of the liquid phase concentrations is equal to the reciprocal of the equilibrium constants:

$$\frac{x_A}{x_B} = \frac{K_B}{K_A} = \frac{1.00}{0.5} = 2.00$$

### Common Pitfalls

*   **Incorrect mole fractions**: Ensure that the mole fractions in the liquid phase are correctly calculated.
