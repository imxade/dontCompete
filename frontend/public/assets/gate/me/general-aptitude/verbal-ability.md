# Verbal Ability - General Aptitude
## Introduction
Verbal Ability is a crucial component of the GATE CS exam, testing a candidate's ability to comprehend and reason with language. This section focuses on applying logical reasoning skills to solve problems involving relationships between words, phrases, and sentences.

## Core Concepts
### 1. Sentence Completion
In sentence completion questions, the subject is incomplete, and you need to determine the correct verb form or auxiliary verb based on the context.
*   For example, "He did not manage to fix the car himself, so he ________ in the garage." The correct answer is (A) got it fixed.

### 2. Analogies
Analogies involve identifying relationships between words and applying them to new situations. They can be based on meanings, sounds, or other linguistic features.
*   For example: "Planting : Seed :: Raising : ?" The correct answer is (A) Child.

## Key Formulas/Theorems
This topic does not require specific formulas or theorems but rather a deep understanding of language structures and relationships.

## Problem Solving Patterns
### 1. Identifying Relationships
To solve verbal ability problems, you need to identify the relationship between words, phrases, or sentences.
*   For example: In the analogy "Planting : Seed :: Raising : ?", the relationship is that planting a seed leads to raising a child.

## Examples with Solutions

### Example 1:
Question: Which one of the following is the CORRECT logical inference based on the information in the passage?

Passage: Fish belonging to species S in the deep sea have skins that are extremely black (ultra-black skin). This helps them not only to avoid predators but also sneakily attack their prey. However, having this extra layer of black pigment results in lower collagen on their skin, making their skin more fragile.

A) Having ultra-black skin is only advantageous to species S
B) Species S with lower collagen in their skin are at an advantage because it helps them avoid predators
C) Having ultra-black skin has both advantages and disadvantages to species S
D) Having ultra-black skin is only disadvantageous to species S but advantageous only to their prey

Solution:
The correct answer is (C). The passage states that having ultra-black skin is both advantageous for avoiding predators and sneakily attacking prey, but it also results in lower collagen on the skin, making it more fragile. Therefore, option C correctly summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of ultra-black skin.

### Example 2:
Question: He did not manage to fix the car himself, so he ________ in the garage.

A) got it fixed
B) getting it fixed
C) gets fixed
D) got fixed

Solution:
The correct answer is (A). Since "he" did not manage to fix the car himself, someone else must have done it. The correct verb form in this context is "got it fixed," which indicates that he had someone else fix the car for him.

## Common Pitfalls
*   Be careful with auxiliary verbs and their usage.
*   Don't get confused between related but distinct concepts.
*   Pay attention to word order, tense, and grammar.

## Quick Summary

*   Sentence completion requires identifying the correct verb form or auxiliary verb based on context.
*   Analogies involve applying relationships between words to new situations.
*   Identifying relationships is key in verbal ability problems.
*   Be mindful of grammar, tense, and word order.
