The available head at the inlet to the turbine is 200 m. \nThe tip speed of the rotor is 40 m/s. Water leaves the runner of the turbine without whirl. Velocity at the \nexit of the draft tube is 3.5 m/s. The head losses in different components of the turbine are : (i) stator and \nguide vanes: 5.0 m,  (ii) Rotor: 10 m, and (iii) Draft tube: 2 m. Flow rate through the turbine is 20 m\n3\n/s. \nTake \n2\n9.8 m/s\ng\n =\n. The hydraulic efficiency of the turbine is ________ % (round off to one decimal\nplace).\nHydraulic Machinery (Turbine) \n \nAns. \n93.43",
