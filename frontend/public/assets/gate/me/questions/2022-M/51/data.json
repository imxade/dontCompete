The \nsteam is then reheated in a reheater and finally expanded\n \nin a low-pressure turbine. The expansion work \nin the high-pressure turbine is\n \n400 kJ/kg and in the low-pressure turbine is 850 kJ/kg, whereas the pump\n\nGATE 2022 \n [Forenoon Session]\nMechanical Engineering\nPAGE\n54\n\nwork\n \nis 15 kJ/kg. If the cycle efficiency is 32%, the heat rejected in the condenser\n \nis ________ kJ/kg \n(round off to 2 decimal places).",
