  "question_text": "Question 45\nA 1 mm thick cylindrical tube, 100 mm in diameter, is orthogonally turned such\n \nthat the entire wall \nthickness of the tube is cut in a single pass. The axial feed of the\n \ntool is 1 m/minute and the specific cutting \nenergy (\nu\n) of the tube material is 6 J/mm\n3\n. Neglect contribution of feed force towards power. The power \nrequired to carry out this operation is ________ kW (round off to one decimal place).",
