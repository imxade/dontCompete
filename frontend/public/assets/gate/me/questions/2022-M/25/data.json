  "question_text": "Question 25\nA flat plate made of cast iron is exposed to a solar flux of 600 W/m\n2\n at an ambient\n \ntemperature of \n0\n25\n C. \nAssume that the entire solar flux is absorbed by the plate.\nCast iron has a low temperature absorptivity of 0.21. Use Stefan-Boltzmann constant\n8\n2\n4\n5.669 10  W/m -K\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf0b4\n. Neglect all other modes of heat transfer except radiation.\nUnder the aforementioned conditions, the radiation equilibrium temperature of the plate is __________\n0\nC\n  (round off to the nearest integer).",
