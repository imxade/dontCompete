The balls at \nP\n \nand \nS\n have equal mass. Assume that there is no \nfriction anywhere and all other\n \ncomponents are massless and rigid. The vertical distance between the\nhorizontal\n \nplane of rotation of the balls and the pivot \n1\nO\n  is denoted by \nh\n. The value of\n \nh\n = 400 mm at a\ncertain \u03c9.
