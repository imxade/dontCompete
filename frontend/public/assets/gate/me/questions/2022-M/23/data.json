Properties of copper\n \nand aluminum are given in the table below.\nMaterial \nAtomic mass (amu) Valency Density (g/cm\n3\n)\nCopper \n63 \n2 \n9\nAluminum \n27 \n3 \n2.7\nIgnore overpotentials, and assume that current efficiency is 100% for both the workpiece materials. Under \nidentical conditions, if the material removal rate (MRR) of copper is 100 mg/s, the MRR of aluminum \nwill be ___________ mg/s (round-off to two decimal places).",
