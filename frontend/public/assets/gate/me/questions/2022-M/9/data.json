  "question_text": "Question 9\nA CNC worktable is driven in a linear direction by a lead screw connected\n \ndirectly to a stepper motor. \nThe pitch of the lead screw is 5 mm. The stepper\n \nmotor completes one full revolution upon receiving 600 \npulses. If the worktable\n \nspeed is 5 m/minute and there is no missed pulse, then the pulse rate being\n \nreceived \nby the stepper motor is\n(A) 20 kHz \n(B) 10 kHz \n(C) 3 kHz \n(D) 15 kHz",
