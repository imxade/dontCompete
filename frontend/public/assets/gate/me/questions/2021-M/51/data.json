The\ntemperature of the surface of the wire is \n0\n75 C\n  when placed in air at \n0\n25 C\n. When the wire is coated\nwith PVC of thickness 1.0 mm, the temperature of the surface of the wire reduces to \n0\n55 C\n . Assuming \nthat the heat generation rate from the wire and the convective heat transfer coefficient are same for \nboth uninsulated wire and the coated wire.
