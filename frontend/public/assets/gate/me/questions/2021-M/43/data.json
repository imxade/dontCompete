To maintain the quality of the indoor air, the intake duct supplies a \nmixture of fresh air with a cold air stream. The two streams are mixed in an insulated mixing \nchamber located upstream of the intake duct. Cold air enters the mixing chamber at 5\n\u02da\n C, 105 kPa \nwith a volume flow rate of 1.25 m\n3\n/s during steady state operation. Fresh air enters the mixing \nchamber at 34\n\u02da\n C and 105 kPa. The mass flow rate of the fresh air is 1.6 times of the cold air stream. \nAir leaves the room through the exit duct at 24\n\u02da\n C\nCold Air\nIntake\nDuct\nROOM\nExit Duct\nFresh Air\nMixing\nChamber\nAssuming the air behaves as an ideal gas with \n1.005kJ/kg.K and =0.287kJ/kg.K,\np\nC\nR\n=\nthe rate of\nheat gain by the air from the room is________kW (round off to two decimal places).\nRefrigeration and Air-conditioning (Mixing of Fluids) \nAns. \n4.96  \n \nSol.\n \nGiven: \n1.6\nf\nc\nm\nm\n=\n\uf026\n\uf026\nTemperature of fresh air \n0\n34 C\n=\n,\nTemperature of cold air \n0\n5 C\n=\n, \n \nSpecific heat at constant pressure, (\n)\n1.005 kJ/kgK\nP\nC\n=\nCharacteristic gas constant, ( )\n0.287 kJ/ kgK\nR\n =\n(Cold air) \nP = 105 kPa\nT = 278 K\n(4)\n(3)\n(1)\nMix.\nchamber \nRoom\n297 K\n3\nV\n1.25 (m /sec)\n=\n\uf026\n(2)\nP =105kPa\nT =307K\n(Fresh air)\n?\nair\nQ\n=\n\uf026\nState 1 : \n \n \n \nPV\nmRT\n=\n\uf026\n\uf026\n \n \n \n \n(105) 1.25\n0.287\n278\nm\n\u00d7\n=\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\uf026\n1.645 kg/sec\nc\nm\n =\n\uf026\n(\n)\n1.6\nf\nc\nm\nm\n=\n\uf026\n\uf026\n\nGATE 2021\n [Forenoon Session]\nMechanical Engineering\nPAGE\n36\n\n(\n)(\n)\n1.6 1.645\nf\nm\n =\n\uf026\n2.632 kg/sec\nf\nm\n =\n\uf026\nEnergy balance for mixing chamber : \n \n \n \n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\nc\nc\nf\nf\nc\nf\nm h\nm h\nm\nm\nh\n+\n=\n+\n\uf026\n\uf026\n\uf026\n\uf026\n[\n] [\n] [\n]\n(1.645) 1.005 278\n(2.632) 1.005 307\n(1.645\n2.632) 1.005\n T\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n+\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n=\n+\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n295.85 K\nT\n =\nLoad calculation for the room (heat taken by the air) \n \n \n \nP\nQ\nmC\nT\n=\n\u0394\n\uf026\n\uf026\n(1.645\n2.632) 1.005 (297\n295.85)\nQ\n =\n+\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u2212\n\uf026\n4.96 kW\nQ\n =\n\uf026\n \nQuestion 44 \n \nA true centrifugal casting operation needs to be performed horizontally to make copper tube section \nwith outer diameter of 250 mm and inner diameter of 230 mm.
