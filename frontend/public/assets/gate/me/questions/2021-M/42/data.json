  "question_text": "Question 42\nA 200 mm wide plate having a thickness of 20 mm is fed through a rolling mill with two rolls. The \nradius of each roll is 300 mm. The plate thickness is to be reduced to 18 mm in one pass using a roll \nspeed of 50 rpm. The strength coefficient (\nK\n) of the work material flow curve is 300 MPa and the \nstrain hardening exponent, \nn\n is 0.2. The coefficient of friction between the rolls and the plate is 0.1. If \nthe friction is sufficient to permit the rolling operation then the roll force will be____________ kN \n(round off to the nearest integer).\nProduction Engineering (Rolling) \nAns. \n930",
