It is connected through a valve to supply line that carries \nair at a constant pressure and temperature of 250 kPa and 400 K respectively. Now the valve is opened \nand air is allowed to flow into the tank until the pressure inside the tank reaches to 250 kPa at which \npoint the valve is closed. Assume that the air behaves as a perfect gas with constant properties \n(c\n1.005 kJ/kgK,\n0.718 kJ/kgK, \n0.287 kJ/kgK)\np\nv\nc\nR\n=\n=\n=\n.
