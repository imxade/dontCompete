  "explanation_text": "Sol.\n \nThe minute hand and second hand of a clock a cross each other one time in every minute but in one hour \n(60 minute) minute hand and second hand crosses each other only for 59 times.  \n \nFor an example, in between 9:00 to 10:00 in one hours they will cross each other for 59 times.  \n \nThe time period in which minute hand and second hand does not cross each other is from 9:00 to 9:01.  \n \nAs at 9:00 minute hand and second hand are already coincided and when second hand starts rotating it \nwill not be coincide with hour hand till 9:01. \n \nThe given time period is from 9:15 am to 9:45 am total minutes are 30.  \n \nIn these 30 minutes, minute hand and second hand will cross each other for 30 times. \n \nHence, the correct option is (A). \nQuestion 5\nThe symbol \n\uf0a1\uf0ad\n\uf044\n\uf0a8\n are to be filled one in each box, as shown below.\nThe rule for filling in the 4 symbols are as follows. \n \n1. \nEvery row and every column must contain each of the 4 symbols. \n \n2. \nEvery \n2 2\n\uf0b4\n square delineated by bold lines must contains each of the 4 symbols.  \n \nWhich symbol will occupy the box marked with \u2018?\u2019 in the partially filled figure?\n? \n \n\uf044\n\uf0a1\n \n\uf0ad\n\uf0a8\n \n\uf0ad\n\uf0ad\n \n \n\uf044\n \n\uf0a1\n(A) \n\uf0a1\n \n(B) \n\uf0ad\n \n \n(C) \n\uf044\n \n(D) \n\uf0a8\nSol.\n \nGiven :  \n \nThe rules for filling in the four symbols : \n\uf0a1\n, \n\uf0ad\n, \n\uf044\n and \n\uf0a8\n are as follows : \n \n1.
