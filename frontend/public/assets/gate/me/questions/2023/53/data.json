The machining process making this part is \nknown to be statistically in control based on sampling data. The sampling data showed that \n1\nD\n  follows a \nnormal distribution with a mean of 20 mm and standard deviation of 0.3mm, while\n2\nD\n  follows  a normal \ndistribution with a mean of 35 mm and standard deviation of 0.4. An inspection of dimension C is carried \nout in a sufficiently large number of parts.\nTo be considered under six-sigma process control, the upper limit of dimension C should be _____ mm. \n(Rounded off to one decimal place)\n1\nD\nC\n2\nD",
