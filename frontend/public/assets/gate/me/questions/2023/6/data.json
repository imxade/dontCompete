Incidentally, almost all of Ravi\u2019s friends at school were hard \nworking and kind too, but the teachers drew attention to Ravi\u2019s complete lack of interest in sports. The \nteachers believed that along with some of his friends who shows similar disinterest in sports, Ravi needed \nto engage in some sports for his overall development.  \n \nBased only on the information provided above, which one of the following statements can be logically \ninferred with certainty? \n \n(A) All of Ravi\u2019s friends are hardworking and kind. \n \n(B) No one who is not a friend of Ravi is hardworking and kind. \n \n(C)  None of Ravi\u2019s friends are interested in sports. \n \n(D) Some of Ravi\u2019s friends are hardworking and kind. \nAns.
