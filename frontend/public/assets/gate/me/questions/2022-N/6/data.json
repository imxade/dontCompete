  "question_text": "Question 6 \n \nFish belonging to species S in the deep sea have skins that are extremely black (ultra-black skin). This \nhelps them not only to avoid predators but also sneakily attack their prey. However, having this extra layer \nof black pigment results in lower collagen on their skin, making their skin more fragile. \n \nWhich one of the following is the CORRECT logical inference based on the information in the above \npassage? \n \n(A)  Having ultra-black skin is only advantageous to species S \n \n(B)  Species S with lower collagen in their skin are at an advantage because it helps them avoid       \n \npredators \n \n(C) Having ultra-black skin has both advantages and disadvantages to species S \n \n(D)  Having ultra-black skin is only disadvantageous to species S but advantageous only to their predators \nAns. \n(C) \nSol. \nOption (C) can be inferred, as having ultra black skin has both advantages and disadvantages to species \nS. \n \nHence, the correct option is (C). \nQuestion 7 \n \nFor the past \n\ud835\udc5a\n days, the average daily production at a company was 100 units per day.  \n \nIf today\u2019s production of 180 units changes the average to 110 units per day, what is the value of \n\ud835\udc5a\n? \n \n(A) 18 \n(B)  10 \n(C)  7 \n(D)  5 \n \nAns. \n(C)",
