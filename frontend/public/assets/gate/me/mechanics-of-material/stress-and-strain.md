**Stress and Strain**
=====================

**Introduction**
---------------

Stress and strain are fundamental concepts in mechanics of materials that describe how a material responds to external loads. In this theory note, we will cover the principles, formulas, and problem-solving techniques required to tackle questions related to stress and strain.

**Core Concepts**
-----------------

### Stress

*   **Definition**: Stress is defined as the normal force per unit area on an object.
*   **Types of Stress**: There are three types of stresses:
    *   **Tensile Stress**: occurs when a material is stretched or pulled apart
    *   **Compressive Stress**: occurs when a material is squeezed or pressed together
    *   **Shear Stress**: occurs when a material is subjected to a force that causes it to deform by sliding along a plane parallel to the direction of the force

### Strain

*   **Definition**: Strain is defined as the ratio of the deformation of an object to its original length or dimension.
*   **Types of Strain**:
    *   **Linear Strain**: occurs when a material deforms uniformly in all directions
    *   **Non-Linear Strain**: occurs when a material deforms non-uniformly in different directions

### Elasticity and Plasticity

*   **Elastic Material**: A material that returns to its original shape after the external load is removed
*   **Plastic Material**: A material that does not return to its original shape after the external load is removed

**Key Formulas/Theorems**
-------------------------

### Stress-Strain Relationship

The stress-strain relationship for elastic materials can be described by Hooke's Law:

$$\sigma = E \cdot \epsilon$$

where $\sigma$ is the stress, $E$ is the modulus of elasticity (also known as Young's Modulus), and $\epsilon$ is the strain.

### Modulus of Elasticity

The modulus of elasticity (E) is defined as the ratio of stress to strain within the proportional limit:

$$E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}$$

**Problem Solving Patterns**
---------------------------

1.  **Determine the Type of Stress or Strain**: Identify whether the problem involves tensile, compressive, or shear stress, and whether it's related to linear or non-linear strain.
2.  **Apply Hooke's Law**: Use the stress-strain relationship formula ($\sigma = E \cdot \epsilon$) to solve problems involving elastic materials.
3.  **Consider Material Properties**: Take into account the material properties (e.g., Young's Modulus, Poisson's Ratio) when solving problems.

**Examples with Solutions**
---------------------------

### Example 1: Stress-Strain Relationship

A steel rod is subjected to a tensile force of 100 N. If the original length of the rod is 10 m and its cross-sectional area is 0.01 m², what is the stress experienced by the rod?

```latex
\sigma = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{100\text{ N}}{0.01\text{ m}^2} = 10000\text{ Pa}
```

### Example 2: Strain Calculation

A metal sheet is stretched to a length of 10.5 m from its original length of 10 m. What is the strain experienced by the sheet?

```latex
\epsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0} = \frac{10.5\text{ m} - 10\text{ m}}{10\text{ m}} = 0.05
```

**Common Pitfalls**
------------------

*   **Misapplication of Hooke's Law**: Be cautious when applying the stress-strain relationship to problems involving plastic materials or non-linear strain.
*   **Inconsistent Units**: Ensure that units are consistent throughout the solution.

**Quick Summary**
-----------------

*   Stress: normal force per unit area, classified into tensile, compressive, and shear stresses
*   Strain: ratio of deformation to original length, classified into linear and non-linear strains
*   Hooke's Law: $\sigma = E \cdot \epsilon$
*   Modulus of Elasticity (E): ratio of stress to strain within the proportional limit
