**Design for Static and Dynamic Loading**
=====================================

**Introduction**
---------------

In machine design, understanding how to optimize components for static and dynamic loading is crucial. This topic focuses on the efficiency of square threaded screws under various loads. The efficiency of a screw is defined as the ratio of work done by the load per revolution to work done by the applied force per revolution.

**Core Concepts**
-----------------

A square threaded screw consists of a cylindrical rod with square notches cut into it at regular intervals. When a load is lifted using such a screw, the force applied is converted into torque, which rotates the screw and lifts the load.

The key concept here is that the efficiency of a screw depends on its thread pitch (the distance between successive threads) and the lead angle (the angle between the tangent to the thread and the vertical). The work done by the load per revolution can be calculated using the formula:

$$W = 2\pi r F \cos(\alpha)$$

where $r$ is the radius of the screw, $F$ is the applied force, and $\alpha$ is the lead angle.

**Key Formulas/Theorems**
-------------------------

*   **Efficiency of a Square Threaded Screw**: The efficiency ($\eta$) of a square threaded screw is given by:

$$\eta = \frac{W}{2\pi r F}$$

where $W$ is the work done by the load per revolution, $r$ is the radius of the screw, and $F$ is the applied force.
*   **Work Done by Load per Revolution**: The work done by the load per revolution ($W$) can be calculated using:

$$W = 2\pi r F \cos(\alpha)$$

where $r$ is the radius of the screw, $F$ is the applied force, and $\alpha$ is the lead angle.

**Problem Solving Patterns**
---------------------------

When solving problems involving square threaded screws, follow these steps:

1.  **Calculate Work Done by Load per Revolution**: Use the formula $W = 2\pi r F \cos(\alpha)$ to calculate the work done by the load per revolution.
2.  **Determine Efficiency of Screw**: Apply the efficiency formula $\eta = \frac{W}{2\pi r F}$ to find the screw's efficiency.

**Examples with Solutions**
---------------------------

### Example 1

A square threaded screw is used to lift a load $W$ by applying a force $F$. The thread pitch of the screw is 10 mm, and the lead angle is 30°. Calculate the efficiency of the screw if the radius of the screw is 20 mm.

**Solution**

Given:
-   Thread pitch = 10 mm
-   Lead angle $\alpha$ = 30°
-   Radius $r$ = 20 mm

First, calculate the work done by the load per revolution:

$$W = 2\pi r F \cos(\alpha)$$

Substituting values:
$$W = 2\pi \times 20 \times F \cos(30^\circ)$$
$$W = 40\pi F \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$
$$W = 20\sqrt{3}\pi F$$

Now, apply the efficiency formula:

$$\eta = \frac{W}{2\pi r F}$$

Substituting values:
$$\eta = \frac{20\sqrt{3}\pi F}{2\pi \times 20 F}$$
$$\eta = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$

### Example 2

A square threaded screw has a radius of 15 mm and is subjected to a force $F$. If the efficiency of the screw is 80%, calculate the work done by the load per revolution if the applied force is 100 N.

**Solution**

Given:
-   Efficiency $\eta$ = 80% or 0.8
-   Applied force $F$ = 100 N
-   Radius $r$ = 15 mm

First, rearrange the efficiency formula to find work done per revolution:

$$W = \eta \times 2\pi r F$$

Substituting values:
$$W = 0.8 \times 2\pi \times 15 \times 100$$
$$W = 1200\pi$$

**Common Pitfalls**
-------------------

When solving problems involving square threaded screws, students often make the following mistakes:

*   **Incorrect calculation of work done by load per revolution**: Students may forget to multiply the applied force by the radius and the cosine of the lead angle.
*   **Miscalculation of efficiency**: Students might incorrectly substitute values into the efficiency formula or neglect to consider units.

**Quick Summary**
----------------

*   Efficiency of a square threaded screw is the ratio of work done by load per revolution to work done by applied force per revolution.
*   Work done by load per revolution can be calculated using $W = 2\pi r F \cos(\alpha)$.
*   Efficiency is given by $\eta = \frac{W}{2\pi r F}$.
