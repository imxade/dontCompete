**Theory Note: Properties of Pure Substances Behavior of Ideal and Real Gases Zeroth and First Laws of Thermodynamics**
==============================================

**Introduction**
---------------

Thermodynamics is a branch of physics that deals with heat, work, temperature, and their relation to energy, radiation, and physical properties of matter. This theory note focuses on the fundamental principles of pure substances, behavior of ideal and real gases, and the zeroth and first laws of thermodynamics.

**Core Concepts**
-----------------

### Pure Substances

A pure substance is a material that has a fixed composition and properties throughout its existence. It can exist in various phases, such as solid, liquid, or gas, depending on temperature and pressure conditions.

### Behavior of Ideal Gases

An ideal gas is a hypothetical gas that obeys the following assumptions:

* The gas molecules are point particles with no volume.
* There are no intermolecular forces between the gas molecules.
* The collisions between the gas molecules and the container walls are elastic.

The behavior of an ideal gas can be described by the equation of state:

PV = nRT

where:
P = pressure
V = volume
n = number of moles
R = gas constant
T = temperature

### Behavior of Real Gases

Real gases deviate from ideal gas behavior due to intermolecular forces and molecular size. The equation of state for real gases is:

PV = ZRT

where:
Z = compressibility factor, a function of temperature and pressure

### Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics

The zeroth law states that if two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.

Mathematically, the zeroth law is expressed as:

T1 = T2

where:
T1 = temperature of system 1
T2 = temperature of system 2

### First Law of Thermodynamics

The first law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another.

Mathematically, the first law is expressed as:

ΔU = Q - W

where:
ΔU = change in internal energy
Q = heat added to the system
W = work done by the system

**Key Formulas/Theorems**
-------------------------

### Specific Volume of Saturated Liquid and Vapour

The specific volume of saturated liquid and vapour can be calculated using the following formulas:

vg = vfg + xlv / (1 - x)

where:
vg = specific volume of saturated vapour
vfg = specific volume of saturated vapour at saturation temperature
x = mole fraction of vapour
lv = latent heat of vaporization

### Total Mass of Liquid-Vapour Mixture

The total mass of liquid-vapour mixture can be calculated using the following formula:

m = mliquid + mvapour

where:
m = total mass of liquid-vapour mixture
mliquid = mass of liquid
mvapour = mass of vapour

**Problem Solving Patterns**
---------------------------

### Example: Q1 (ID: me_2021-N_3)

A rigid tank of volume 50 m^3 contains a pure substance as a saturated liquid-vapour mixture at 400 kPa. Of the total mass of the mixture, 20% mass is liquid and 80% mass is vapour.

Properties at 400 kPa are:

* Saturation temperature: 143.61°C
* Specific volume of saturated liquid: 0.001084 m^3/kg
* Specific volume of saturated vapour: 0.46242 m^3/kg

Find the total mass of liquid-vapour mixture in the tank.

**Solution**

1. Calculate the specific volume of the mixture:

vg = vfg + xlv / (1 - x)
= 0.001084 + (0.8 \* 0.46242) / (1 - 0.8)
= 0.37032 m^3/kg

2. Calculate the mass of liquid and vapour:

mliquid = m / (vfg / lv)
= (m \* 0.001084) / (1.21 \* 10^6)
mvapour = m - ml

3. Calculate the total mass of the mixture:

m = mliquid + mvapour
= (20% \* m) + (80% \* m)
= 1.35 kg (rounded off to the nearest integer)

**Common Pitfalls**
------------------

* Forgetting to convert units correctly.
* Not considering the compressibility factor for real gases.

**Quick Summary**
----------------

* Pure substances have fixed composition and properties.
* Ideal gases obey the equation of state: PV = nRT.
* Real gases deviate from ideal gas behavior due to intermolecular forces and molecular size.
* The zeroth law states that if two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.
* The first law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another.
