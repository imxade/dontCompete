**Pure Substance**
================

### Introduction
A pure substance is a thermodynamic system that consists of only one type of matter, with no changes in chemical composition during the process. The behavior of a pure substance can be described by its thermodynamic properties, such as pressure, volume, temperature, and internal energy.

### Core Concepts
A key concept in understanding pure substances is the idea of a **thermodynamic property**, which is any measurable quantity that describes the state of the system. For example, pressure, volume, temperature, and internal energy are all thermodynamic properties.

Another important concept is the **ideal gas model**, which assumes that a gas behaves like an ideal gas if its compressibility factor (Z) is close to 1. The ideal gas equation of state is given by:

$$PV = nRT$$

where $P$ is pressure, $V$ is volume, $n$ is the number of moles, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is temperature.

### Key Formulas/Theorems
We will need to use the ideal gas equation of state and the definition of the compressibility factor (Z) to solve the source questions. The compressibility factor is defined as:

$$Z = \frac{PV}{nRT}$$

where $P$ is pressure, $V$ is volume, $n$ is the number of moles, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is temperature.

### Problem Solving Patterns
To solve problems involving pure substances, we need to follow these steps:

1.  Identify the thermodynamic properties given in the problem.
2.  Determine if the system can be approximated as an ideal gas using the compressibility factor (Z).
3.  Use the ideal gas equation of state or other relevant equations to find the unknown quantity.

### Examples with Solutions
**Example 1:** A superheated steam has a specific volume of $3\, \text{m}^2/\text{kg}$ and a compressibility factor (Z) of 0.95. Find the temperature of the steam in Celsius.

## Step 1: Determine if the system can be approximated as an ideal gas.
Since Z = 0.95, which is close to 1, we can assume that the steam behaves like an ideal gas.

## Step 2: Use the ideal gas equation of state to find the temperature.
We are given $P$, $V$, and $n$. We need to find T. Since $Z \approx 1$, we can use the ideal gas equation:

$$PV = nRT$$

Rearranging for T, we get:

$$T = \frac{PV}{nR}$$

## Step 3: Plug in the values and solve for T.
Given data:
$P = 1500\,\text{kPa}$,
$n = 1\,\text{kmol}$ (for simplicity),
and $V = 3.2.75 \,\text{m}^2/\text{kg}$. We will need to convert this volume to $\text{m}^3$.

## Step 4: Solve for T.
First, we find the volume in cubic meters:

$$V = 3.2.75\,\text{m}^2/\text{kmol} \times 1000\,\text{kg}/1\,\text{kmol} = 3675\,\text{m}^3/$$\text{k}\text{mol}$

Then, we use the ideal gas equation to solve for T:

$$T = \frac{(1500\,\text{kPa})(3675\,\text{m}^3)}{(1\,\text{kmol})(8.314\,\text{J}/(\text{mol}\cdot\text{K}))}$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$T = 249\,\text{K} \approx 249^\circ\text{C}$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{249}$

### Common Pitfalls
-   Assuming a system is an ideal gas when the compressibility factor (Z) is far from 1.
-   Failing to convert units correctly.

### Quick Summary
-   A pure substance is a thermodynamic system consisting of only one type of matter.
-   The behavior of a pure substance can be described by its thermodynamic properties, such as pressure, volume, temperature, and internal energy.
-   Ideal gas model: assumes a gas behaves like an ideal gas if Z ≈ 1.
-   Key formulas:
    -   Ideal gas equation of state: PV = nRT
