**Critical Buckling Load**
=========================

### Introduction
The critical buckling load of a column is the maximum axial compressive load that a column can withstand without undergoing significant deformation or failure. In this note, we will explore the key concepts and formulas related to critical buckling load.

### Core Concepts

#### 1. Euler's Buckling Theory
Euler's buckling theory states that the critical buckling load of a long, slender column is proportional to the fourth power of its length and inversely proportional to the square of its radius of gyration.

#### 2. Critical Buckling Load Formula
The formula for critical buckling load (Pcr) is given by:

$$ P_{cr} = \frac{\pi^2 E I}{L^2} $$

where E is the modulus of elasticity, I is the moment of inertia, and L is the length of the column.

#### 3. Boundary Conditions
The boundary conditions of a column play a crucial role in determining its critical buckling load. The most common boundary conditions are:

* **Fixed-Fixed**: Both ends of the column are fixed.
* **Pinned-Pinned**: One end is pinned and the other end is free to rotate.
* **Fixed-Free**: One end is fixed and the other end is free.

### Key Formulas/Theorems

$$ P_{cr} = \frac{\pi^2 E I}{L^2} $$

$$ P_{L} = \frac{4 E I}{L^3} $$

### Problem Solving Patterns

1. **Identify the boundary conditions**: Determine the type of boundary conditions (fixed, pinned, or free).
2. **Calculate the moment of inertia**: Use the appropriate formula for the moment of inertia based on the shape and material of the column.
3. **Apply Euler's buckling theory**: Use the formula for critical buckling load to calculate the maximum axial compressive load.

### Examples with Solutions

#### Example 1
A fixed-free column has a length (L) of 2 meters, a moment of inertia (I) of 100 mm^4, and a modulus of elasticity (E) of 200 GPa. What is its critical buckling load?

Solution:

$$ P_{cr} = \frac{\pi^2 E I}{L^2} $$

$$ P_{cr} = \frac{\pi^2 \times 200 \times 10^9 \times 100 \times 10^{-12}}{2^2} $$

$$ P_{cr} = 986.5 N $$

#### Example 2
A pinned-pinned column has a length (L) of 4 meters, a moment of inertia (I) of 200 mm^4, and a modulus of elasticity (E) of 300 GPa. What is its critical buckling load?

Solution:

$$ P_{cr} = \frac{\pi^2 E I}{L^2} $$

$$ P_{cr} = \frac{\pi^2 \times 300 \times 10^9 \times 200 \times 10^{-12}}{4^2} $$

$$ P_{cr} = 1.93 kN $$

### Common Pitfalls

* **Incorrect boundary conditions**: Failing to identify the correct boundary conditions can lead to incorrect critical buckling loads.
* **Inaccurate moment of inertia**: Calculating an inaccurate moment of inertia can result in incorrect critical buckling loads.

### Quick Summary
• Identify the boundary conditions (fixed, pinned, or free).
• Calculate the moment of inertia using the appropriate formula.
