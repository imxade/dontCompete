Additive Manufacturing
=====================

### Introduction

Additive manufacturing (AM) is a layer-by-layer process of building a product from digital models by depositing or joining materials such as metals, plastics, ceramics, and composites. AM allows for complex geometries and structures that cannot be produced through traditional subtractive methods.

### Core Concepts

**Definition**: Additive Manufacturing is the process of creating products from 3D model data by adding materials layer upon layer.

**Types**: There are seven basic types of additive manufacturing techniques:

1. **Stereolithography (SLA)**: Uses a laser to solidify liquid resin.
2. **Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)**: Extrudes melted plastic through a heated nozzle.
3. **Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)**: Fuses together particles of material using a high-powered laser.
4. **Directed Energy Deposition (DED)**: Deposits metal or other materials onto a substrate using a focused beam.
5. **Laminated Object Manufacturing (LOM)**: Builds parts by gluing together layers of material.
6. **Binder Jetting**: Uses a liquid binder to "glue" together particles of material.
7. **Powder Bed Fusion**: Fuses together particles of metal or plastic powder using a high-powered laser.

**Key Characteristics**: AM offers advantages such as:

* Complex geometries
* Reduced material waste
* Increased design flexibility

### Key Formulas/Theorems

No specific formulas are required for this topic, but an understanding of the principles and processes involved is crucial for problem-solving.

### Problem Solving Patterns

1. **Identify the AM technique**: Determine which type of additive manufacturing is being used based on the materials and process described.
2. **Understand the process flow**: Visualize the layer-by-layer process of building a product from digital models.
3. **Consider material properties**: Think about the characteristics of the materials involved, such as strength, density, and thermal conductivity.

### Examples with Solutions

**Example 1**

Q: Which of the following additive manufacturing techniques can use a wire as a feedstock material?

A: (B & D)

Explanation:

* Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) uses extruded melted plastic, which can be obtained from a wire.
* Directed Energy Deposition (DED) deposits metal or other materials onto a substrate using a focused beam, where the feedstock can be in the form of a wire.

**Example 2**

Q: What are the key advantages of additive manufacturing?

A:

* Complex geometries
* Reduced material waste
* Increased design flexibility

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Confusing AM with other techniques**: Be aware that terms like "rapid prototyping" or "rapid tooling" might be related to AM, but they are not equivalent.
2. **Overlooking material properties**: Remember that the choice of material significantly affects the final product's performance.
