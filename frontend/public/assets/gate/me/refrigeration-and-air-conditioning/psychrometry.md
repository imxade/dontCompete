**Psychrometry Theory Note**
==========================

### Introduction

Psychrometry is a crucial aspect of refrigeration and air conditioning that deals with the study of the properties of air-water mixtures. Understanding psychrometry is essential for designing and optimizing heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems.

### Core Concepts

#### Psychometric Chart

A psychometric chart is a graphical representation of the thermodynamic properties of moist air. It plots the enthalpy or specific humidity against temperature. The chart can be used to determine various properties such as relative humidity, dew point temperature, and wet-bulb temperature.

#### Specific Humidity

Specific humidity (ω) is the mass of water vapor per unit mass of dry air in a mixture. It can be calculated using the formula:

$$\omega = \frac{0.622p_v}{p - p_v}$$

where $p_v$ is the partial pressure of water vapor, and $p$ is the total pressure.

#### Relative Humidity

Relative humidity (RH) is defined as the ratio of the actual water vapor pressure to the saturation water vapor pressure at a given temperature. It can be calculated using the formula:

$$RH = \frac{p_v}{p_{sat}} \times 100\%$$

where $p_{sat}$ is the saturation water vapor pressure.

### Key Formulas/Theorems

* Specific humidity: $\omega = \frac{0.622p_v}{p - p_v}$
* Relative humidity: $RH = \frac{p_v}{p_{sat}} \times 100\%$

### Problem Solving Patterns

When solving psychrometry problems, follow these steps:

1. Determine the properties of the air-water mixture using a psychometric chart or the formulas above.
2. Calculate specific humidity and relative humidity as required.

### Examples with Solutions

**Example 1**

Determine the specific humidity of an air-water mixture at 300 K with a partial pressure of water vapor equal to 0.5 kPa, given that the saturation pressure of water at 300 K is 3.2 kPa.

Solution:

Using the formula for specific humidity:

$$\omega = \frac{0.622p_v}{p - p_v} = \frac{0.622(0.5)}{(101)(0.5)} = 0.0617 kg/kg_{da}$$

**Example 2**

An air-water mixture has a temperature of 300 K and relative humidity of 60%. Determine the specific humidity of the mixture, given that the saturation pressure of water at 300 K is 3.6 kPa.

Solution:

Using the formula for relative humidity:

$$RH = \frac{p_v}{p_{sat}} \times 100\%$$

Rearranging to solve for $p_v$:

$$p_v = RH \times p_{sat} = (0.6)(3.6) = 2.16 kPa$$

Using the formula for specific humidity:

$$\omega = \frac{0.622p_v}{p - p_v} = \frac{0.622(2.16)}{(101)(2.16)} = 0.0134 kg/kg_{da}$$

### Common Pitfalls

* Failing to calculate specific humidity or relative humidity correctly.
* Not considering the saturation pressure of water at the given temperature.
* Misinterpreting the psychometric chart.

### Quick Summary

* Specific humidity: $\omega = \frac{0.622p_v}{p - p_v}$
* Relative humidity: $RH = \frac{p_v}{p_{sat}} \times 100\%$
