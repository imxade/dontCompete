**Economic Load Dispatch**
=========================

### Introduction

Economic load dispatch (ELD) is a technique used to allocate real power generation among available generating units at various power plants so as to meet the system demand with minimum fuel cost. It is a critical component of power system operation, as it directly affects the efficiency and reliability of the grid.

### Core Concepts

*   **Load Demand**: The total amount of electrical energy required by consumers.
*   **Generation Capacity**: The maximum amount of electrical energy that can be generated by power plants.
*   **Fuel Cost**: The cost of fuel consumed by generating units to produce electricity.
*   **Operating Costs**: Other costs associated with running a power plant, such as maintenance and labor expenses.

### Key Formulas/Theorems

The ELD problem can be mathematically represented using the following equation:

$$P_i = P_{i,max} \cdot (1 - \alpha_i)$$

where:
*   $P_i$ is the real power output of unit $i$
*   $P_{i,max}$ is the maximum real power output of unit $i$
*   $\alpha_i$ is the fractional reserve margin for unit $i$

The fuel cost function for a generating unit can be represented as:

$$F(P_i) = \beta_i + \gamma_i P_i + \delta_i P_i^2$$

where:
*   $F(P_i)$ is the fuel cost of unit $i$
*   $\beta_i$, $\gamma_i$, and $\delta_i$ are coefficients representing the fuel cost function

### Problem Solving Patterns

To solve ELD problems, follow these steps:

1.  **Formulate the problem**: Write down the objective function (to minimize) and any constraints.
2.  **Choose a method**: Select an optimization technique (e.g., linear programming, dynamic programming).
3.  **Implement the solution**: Use software or code to find the optimal solution.

### Examples with Solutions

**Example**

Given:

*   Three power plants with maximum real power outputs $P_{1,max} = 100$, $P_{2,max} = 120$, and $P_{3,max} = 90$ MW
*   Fractional reserve margins $\alpha_1 = 0.2$, $\alpha_2 = 0.15$, and $\alpha_3 = 0.25$
*   Fuel cost coefficients $\beta_1 = 10$, $\gamma_1 = 5$, $\delta_1 = 0.1$; $\beta_2 = 12$, $\gamma_2 = 6$, $\delta_2 = 0.15$; and $\beta_3 = 8$, $\gamma_3 = 4$, $\delta_3 = 0.05$

The system demand is $P_{demand} = 250$ MW.

**Solution**

1.  Formulate the problem:

$$\text{Minimize: } F(P_1, P_2, P_3) = \beta_1 + \gamma_1 P_1 + \delta_1 P_1^2 + \beta_2 + \gamma_2 P_2 + \delta_2 P_2^2 + \beta_3 + \gamma_3 P_3 + \delta_3 P_3^2$$

Subject to:

*   $P_{demand} = P_1 + P_2 + P_3$
*   $0 \leq P_i \leq P_{i,max}$ for each unit

2.  Choose a method: Linear programming (LP) is suitable for this problem.

3.  Implement the solution:

```python
import pulp

# Define variables and parameters
P1 = pulp.LpVariable("P1", lowBound=0, upBound=100)
P2 = pulp.LpVariable("P2", lowBound=0, upBound=120)
P3 = pulp.LpVariable("P3", lowBound=0, upBound=90)

# Define the objective function and constraints
prob = pulp.LpProblem("ELD_Problem", pulp.LpMinimize)
prob += (10 + 5*P1 + 0.1*P1**2) + (12 + 6*P2 + 0.15*P2**2) + (8 + 4*P3 + 0.05*P3**2)

prob += P1 + P2 + P3 == 250

# Solve the problem
status = prob.solve()

# Print the solution
if status == pulp.LpStatus.OPTIMAL:
    print("Optimal real power outputs:")
    print(f"P1: {P1.value()} MW")
    print(f"P2: {P2.value()} MW")
    print(f"P3: {P3.value()} MW")

```

### Common Pitfalls

*   **Inadequate formulation**: Failing to include important constraints or objective functions.
*   **Insufficient data**: Lack of accurate and complete data for fuel cost coefficients, maximum real power outputs, and other parameters.
