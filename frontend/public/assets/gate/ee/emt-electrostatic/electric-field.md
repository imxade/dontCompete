**Electric Field**
================

### Introduction
----------------

The electric field is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism that describes the force exerted by a charged particle on other charges. It's crucial for understanding various phenomena, from the behavior of atoms and molecules to the functioning of electrical circuits.

### Core Concepts
-----------------

#### Electric Charges and Fields

*   A point charge generates an electric field around itself.
*   The direction of the electric field at any point is along the line connecting the point charge to that point.
*   The magnitude of the electric field due to a point charge decreases with increasing distance.

#### Superposition Principle

*   The total electric field at a point due to multiple charges is the vector sum of the individual fields.

#### Electric Field and Potential

*   The electric potential at a point is the work done per unit charge in moving from infinity to that point.
*   The electric field is related to the electric potential by $E = -\nabla V$.

### Key Formulas/Theorems
-------------------------

#### Coulomb's Law

$$F = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$$

where $F$ is the electric force between two charges, $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the magnitudes of the charges, $r$ is the distance between them, and $\varepsilon_0$ is the electric constant.

#### Electric Field due to a Point Charge

$$E = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2}$$

where $E$ is the magnitude of the electric field, $q$ is the magnitude of the point charge, and $r$ is the distance from the charge.

### Problem Solving Patterns
-----------------------------

#### Finding Electric Field at a Point Due to Multiple Charges

*   Break down the problem into individual contributions from each charge.
*   Use the superposition principle to find the total electric field.
*   Consider the direction of the electric field due to each charge and apply vector addition.

### Examples with Solutions
---------------------------

**Example 1: Electric Field at a Point Due to Two Charges**

Suppose two charges $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are located at points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ respectively. Find the electric field at point $(x, y)$ due to these charges.

*   Find the individual contributions from each charge using the formula for electric field due to a point charge.
*   Apply the superposition principle to find the total electric field.

**Example 2: Electric Field in Free Space**

Suppose three point-charges $Q_1$, $Q_2$, and $Q_3$ are located at points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, and $(x_3, y_3)$ respectively. Find the electric field in free space.

*   Use the formula for electric field due to a point charge to find individual contributions from each charge.
*   Apply the superposition principle to find the total electric field.

### Common Pitfalls
------------------

#### Ignoring Direction of Electric Field

*   When adding vectors, consider both magnitude and direction.

#### Not Applying Superposition Principle

*   The total electric field is the vector sum of individual fields due to each charge.

#### Incorrect Application of Coulomb's Law

*   Make sure to use the correct formula for electric force between charges.

### Quick Summary
-----------------

*   Electric field is a vector quantity that describes the force exerted by a charged particle on other charges.
*   The direction of the electric field at any point is along the line connecting the point charge to that point.
*   Use Coulomb's law and the superposition principle to find electric fields due to multiple charges.
