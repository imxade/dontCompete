**Examples with Solutions**
---------------------------

### Example 1: Fill in the Blanks

 Sentence: The new policy _______ to reduce pollution in urban areas.

A) aims
B) intends
C) is intended
D) has been intended

Solution:
The correct answer is (C). "Is intended" fits grammatically as a present continuous tense verb phrase. It implies an ongoing or planned action, which aligns with the context of reducing pollution.

### Example 2: Error Spotting

 Sentence: The company _______ its profits by 20% last quarter.

A) has increased
B) have increased
C) is increasing
D) were increasing

Solution:
The correct answer is (A). "Has increased" correctly uses the past perfect tense to indicate that the action of increasing profits occurred before another action in the past. It also maintains grammatical consistency with the rest of the sentence.

### Example 3: Reading Comprehension

 Passage: The new CEO's decision to relocate the company's headquarters has caused a significant stir among employees. Many are concerned about the impact on their jobs and working conditions.

Question: What is the main idea of the passage?

A) Employees are unhappy with the new CEO.

C) Employee concerns have been ignored by management.
D) Job security is a major issue among employees.

Solution:
The correct answer is (B). The passage primarily discusses the decision to relocate the company's headquarters, which has caused concern among employees. This demonstrates an understanding of the main idea and supporting details in reading comprehension.
