**Spatial Aptitude Transformation of Shapes**
=============================================

**Introduction**
---------------

Spatial aptitude involves understanding and manipulating shapes, objects, and patterns in 2D and 3D spaces. This concept is crucial for various fields, including architecture, engineering, and design.

**Core Concepts**
-----------------

### 1. Translation

Translation refers to moving an object from one location to another without changing its orientation or size.

*   **Types of translation:** 
    *   Horizontal translation: movement along the x-axis
    *   Vertical translation: movement along the y-axis
    *   Rotational translation: movement around a central point

### 2. Rotation

Rotation is a transformation that turns an object around a fixed axis or point.

*   **Types of rotation:** 
    *   Clockwise rotation: rotation in a clockwise direction
    *   Counterclockwise rotation: rotation in a counterclockwise direction

### 3. Scaling

Scaling involves changing the size of an object while maintaining its shape and orientation.

*   **Types of scaling:**
    *   Enlargement: increasing the size of an object
    *   Reduction: decreasing the size of an object

### 4. Mirroring (Reflection)

Mirroring is a transformation that flips an object over a fixed line or point, creating a mirror image.

### 5. Assembling and Grouping

Assembling involves combining multiple shapes to form a new shape, while grouping refers to dividing a single shape into smaller shapes.

### 6. Paper Folding and Cutting

Paper folding and cutting involve manipulating paper to create specific shapes and patterns.

*   **Basic folds:** 
    *   Valley fold: folding an edge of the paper towards the center
    *   Mountain fold: folding an edge of the paper away from the center

**Key Formulas/Theorems**
-------------------------

*   None applicable for this topic.

**Problem Solving Patterns**
---------------------------

1.  **Shape Identification:** Identify the type of shape and its properties.
2.  **Transformation Application:** Apply transformation rules to manipulate shapes.
3.  **Pattern Recognition:** Recognize patterns in shapes, such as symmetries or tessellations.
4.  **Geometric Reasoning:** Use geometric principles to analyze and solve problems.

**Examples with Solutions**
---------------------------

### Example 1: Translation

A rectangle is translated 5 units to the right. What is the new position of the rectangle?

*   Initial position: (0, 0)
*   Translation: 5 units to the right
*   New position: (5, 0)

### Example 2: Rotation

A square is rotated 90° clockwise around its central point. What is the new orientation of the square?

*   Initial orientation: horizontal
*   Rotation: 90° clockwise
*   New orientation: vertical

**Common Pitfalls**
------------------

1.  **Confusing translation with rotation:** Be aware of the difference between these two transformations.
2.  **Failing to identify symmetries:** Recognize patterns and symmetries in shapes to solve problems efficiently.

### Q1 (ID: ee_2020_6)

The cross-section of a metal-oxide-semiconductor structure is shown schematically. Starting from an uncharged condition, a bias of +3 V is applied to the gate contact with respect to the body contact. The charge inside the silicon dioxide layer is then measured to be +Q. The total charge contained within the dashed box shown, upon application of bias, expressed as a multiple of Q (absolute value in Coulombs, rounded off to the nearest integer) is ____________.

This question involves understanding the concept of charge distribution and capacitance in a metal-oxide-semiconductor structure.

**Analysis**
-------------

*   The problem describes a metal-oxide-semiconductor structure with a gate contact and body contact.
*   A bias of +3 V is applied to the gate contact, causing a change in the charge inside the silicon dioxide layer.
*   The total charge contained within the dashed box is to be determined as a multiple of Q.

**Solution**
------------

To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of capacitance and how it affects the charge distribution in the metal-oxide-semiconductor structure. We can use the formula for capacitance:

C = ε \* A / d

where C is the capacitance, ε is the permittivity of the material, A is the area of the plate, and d is the distance between the plates.

In this case, the charge inside the silicon dioxide layer is +Q. Since the bias applied to the gate contact is +3 V, the total charge contained within the dashed box will be affected by the capacitance of the structure.

Using the formula for capacitance, we can calculate the total charge contained within the dashed box as:

Total Charge = C \* ΔV

where ΔV is the change in voltage across the capacitor.

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

Total Charge = (ε \* A / d) \* (+3 V)

Simplifying and rounding off to the nearest integer, we get:

Total Charge ≈ 0

Therefore, the total charge contained within the dashed box is approximately 0.

This solution demonstrates how to apply geometric reasoning and understanding of capacitance to solve a problem involving spatial aptitude.
