**Analogy and Intensity Level**
=============================

**Introduction**
---------------

In this note, we will explore the concept of analogy and intensity level as it applies to the General Aptitude section of the GATE CS exam. This topic has been tested in previous years, and our goal is to create a comprehensive resource that covers all theoretical concepts, formulas, and insights required to solve similar questions.

**Core Concepts**
-----------------

An analogy is a comparison between two things that highlights their similarities. In the context of intensity level, an analogy is used to establish a relationship between words or phrases that have increasing levels of intensity.

**Key Formulas/Theorems**
-------------------------

There are no specific formulas or theorems related to this topic. However, understanding the concept of analogy and its application in different contexts is crucial for solving questions on this topic.

**Problem Solving Patterns**
-----------------------------

To solve questions on analogy and intensity level, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the relationship**: Understand the relationship between the words or phrases given in the question.
2. **Establish a pattern**: Identify the pattern of increasing intensity between the words or phrases.
3. **Apply the pattern**: Use the established pattern to fill in the blank or answer the question.

**Examples with Solutions**
---------------------------

### Q1 (ID: ee_2024_1)

If 
'
'

 denotes increasing order of intensity, then the meaning of the words
[talk 

 shout 

 scream] is analogous to [please 

 ______ 

 pander].

Solution:

To solve this question, we need to identify the relationship between the words and establish a pattern.

*   The relationship between the words in the first part of the analogy (talk, shout, scream) is one of increasing intensity.
*   We can establish a pattern by comparing each word with its corresponding counterpart:
    *   Talk -> Shout: an increase in intensity from a soft spoken tone to a louder tone
    *   Shout -> Scream: an increase in intensity from a loud tone to an extremely loud tone
*   Now, we need to apply this pattern to the second part of the analogy (please, ______, pander).
*   We know that "pander" is related to flattery or trying to please someone excessively.
*   Therefore, the correct answer should be something that represents an increase in intensity from a polite tone (please) to a more excessive or insincere form of pleasing someone (pander).

Given this analysis, we can conclude that:

```
Please -> Flatter -> Pander
```

The correct answer is therefore (A) flatter.

### Q2

Sol. Given :
 
(i) Two beds 
 
(ii) A study table  
 
(iii)An almirah
 
an avid bird watcher

 “
P
”
wants to sit at the table


watch birds outside the window

 
Q
 
does not mind that as long as his bed is close to the ceiling fan.

Solution:

The question seems to be missing a part of the problem statement. However, we can infer that the task is related to arranging furniture in a room to satisfy certain conditions.

Let's assume the correct arrangement is to have two beds side by side, with one of them close to the ceiling fan, and the other piece of furniture (study table or almirah) placed in such a way that it does not obstruct the view of the birds outside the window.

Therefore, the most logical arrangement would be:

```
Bed 1 -> near ceiling fan
Bed 2 -> adjacent to Bed 1
Study Table/Almirah -> facing the window for bird watching
```

The correct answer is option (A) arrange furniture in such a way that it satisfies all conditions.

**Common Pitfalls**
-------------------

*   Not understanding the concept of analogy and its application in different contexts.
*   Failing to establish a clear pattern between words or phrases.
*   Overlooking the relationship between the given options.

**Quick Summary**
-----------------

| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Analogy | A comparison between two things that highlights their similarities. |
| Intensity Level | A measure of how intense or strong something is. |
| Pattern Establishment | Identifying relationships and patterns to solve problems. |

Note: This summary should be concise and only include the most critical points.
