**Logical Inference**
=====================

**Introduction**
---------------

Logical inference is a fundamental concept in General Aptitude that deals with drawing conclusions based on given premises or statements. It involves analyzing the relationships between different pieces of information to arrive at a logical conclusion.

**Core Concepts**
-----------------

*   **Premise**: A statement that provides the basis for an argument.
*   **Conclusion**: The statement that follows from the premise(s).
*   **Logical Connectives**: Symbols used to connect premises and conclusions, such as "and," "or," "if-then" ($\rightarrow$), etc.

**Key Formulas/Theorems**
-------------------------

### Modus Ponens

If $p \rightarrow q$ and $p$, then $q$

$$\frac{p \rightarrow q}{p} \vdash q$$

### Hypothetical Syllogism

If $p \rightarrow q$ and $q \rightarrow r$, then $p \rightarrow r$

$$\frac{p \rightarrow q}{q \rightarrow r} \vdash p \rightarrow r$$

**Problem Solving Patterns**
---------------------------

1.  **Identify the Premise**: Determine the statement(s) that provide the basis for the argument.
2.  **Analyze the Relationships**: Examine the logical connectives and relationships between premises and conclusions.
3.  **Draw the Conclusion**: Use logical rules (e.g., modus ponens, hypothetical syllogism) to arrive at a conclusion.

**Examples with Solutions**
---------------------------

### Example 1: Modus Ponens

 Premise: If it rains ($p$), then I will bring an umbrella ($q$).
Premise: It is raining ($p$).

Conclusion: Therefore, I will bring an umbrella ($q$).

Solution:

1.  Identify the premise: $p \rightarrow q$
2.  Analyze the relationships: Given that $p$, we can conclude $q$ using modus ponens.
3.  Draw the conclusion: Since it is raining (premise), and if it rains, I will bring an umbrella ($p \rightarrow q$), then I will bring an umbrella.

### Example 2: Hypothetical Syllogism

 Premise: If I am healthy ($p$), then I can exercise ($q$).
Premise: If I can exercise ($q$), then I feel energized ($r$).

Conclusion: Therefore, if I am healthy ($p$), then I feel energized ($r$).

Solution:

1.  Identify the premise: $p \rightarrow q$
2.  Analyze the relationships: Given that $q \rightarrow r$, we can use hypothetical syllogism to conclude $p \rightarrow r$.
3.  Draw the conclusion: Since if I am healthy, then I can exercise ($p \rightarrow q$), and if I can exercise, then I feel energized ($q \rightarrow r$), then if I am healthy, I feel energized.

**Common Pitfalls**
-------------------

1.  **Missing Premises**: Failing to identify all relevant premises.
2.  **Incorrect Inference**: Drawing an incorrect conclusion based on the given premises.
3.  **Lack of Analysis**: Not examining the relationships between premises and conclusions.

**Quick Summary**
------------------

*   Identify the premise(s) and analyze their relationships.
*   Use logical rules (e.g., modus ponens, hypothetical syllogism) to draw a conclusion.
*   Be cautious of missing premises and incorrect inferences.
