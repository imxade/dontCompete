Keeping the voltage at bus 2\nfixed at 1 pu, magnitude of voltage at bus 1 is changed, so that the reactive power \n12\nQ\n  sent from bus 1 is\nincreased by 20%. Real power flow through the line under both the condition is zero. The new value of \nthe voltage magnitude, \n1\nV\n , in pu (rounded off to 2 decimal places), at bus 1 is __________.\n1\nV\n2\nV\n12\nQ\nBus 2\nBus 1",
