The effective thermal voltage \n,\nT\nV\n for the diode is measured to be \n(29\n2)\n\uf0b1\nmV. The resolution\nof voltage source in the measurement range is 1mV. The percentage uncertainty (rounded off to 2 decimal \nplaces) in the measured current at a bias voltage of 0.02 V is _____. \nAns. \n4.75 \nSol.\n \nGiven : \n0.02V\nD\nV\n \uf03d\n(29\n2)mV\n(0.029\n0.002)\nT\nV\n \uf03d\n\uf0b1\n\uf03d\n\uf0b1\nD\nT\nV\nV\nD\nI\nI\nI e\n\uf068\n\uf03d\n\uf040\n/\n0\nNon ideal silicon diode is as shown below\n0\nD\nI\nI\n\u0004\n\u0007\n\u0006\nD\nV\nApplying log on both sides on diode current equation\nV\nI\nI\nV\n\uf03d\n\uf068\n0\nln ( )\nln(\n)+\nD\nT\nDifferentiating partially with respect to \nT\nV\n ,\nV\nI\nV\nI\nV\n\uf0e6\n\uf0f6\n\uf0b6\uf03d\n\uf02b\n\uf0b4\uf02d\n\uf0b6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0f7\n\uf068\n\uf0e8\n\uf0f8\n2\n1\n0\nD\nT\nT\nIV\nI\nV\nI\nV\n\uf0b6\uf03d\uf02d\n\uf0b4\uf0b6\n\uf068\n2\nD\nT\nT\nI V\nI\nV\nV\n\uf0b6\n\uf03d\uf02d\n\uf0b6\nFor \n[\n1]\n\uf068\uf03d\n, \n2\n.\nD\nT\nT\nThe expression of uncertainty for diode current equation is given below,\n\nGATE 2020 \n [Forenoon Session]\n \nElectrical Engineering\nPAGE\n45\n\n2\nI\nI\nW\nW\nW\nW\nV\nV\n\uf0e6\n\uf0f6\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\uf0b1\n\uf03d\uf0b1\n\uf0b4\n\uf0e7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf0e8\n\uf0f8\n2\n.\nres\nI\nv\nV\nT\nT\n\n\uf0b4\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\uf0b1\n\uf03d\uf0b1\n\uf0b4\n0.0475\nI\n\uf03d\uf0b1\nI V\nI\nW\nW\nW\nV\n2\n2\n.\n0.02\n.\n0.002\n(0.029)\nD\nres\nI\nV\nT\n%\n0.0475 100\n4.75\nI\nW\nI\n \n\uf03d\uf0b1\n\uf0b4\n\uf03d\uf0b1\nPercentage uncertainty \n4.75%\n\uf03d\uf0b1",
