  "question_text": "Question 6\nThe cross-section of a metal-oxide-semiconductor structure is shown schematically. Starting from an \nuncharged condition, a bias o f + 3 V is applied to the gate contact with respect to the body contact. The \ncharge inside the silicon dioxide layer is then measured to be +\nQ\n. The total charge contained within the \ndashed box shown, upon application of bias, expressed as a multiple of \nQ\n (absolute value in Coulombs, \nrounded off to the nearest integer) is ____________.\nGATE\nSilicon Dioxide\nSi\nBODY",
