  "question_text": "Question 1 \n \nWhich of the following statements is true about the two sided Laplace transform? \n \n(A) It exists for every signal that may or may not have a Fourier Transform. \n \n(B) It has no poles for any bounded signal that is non-zero only inside a finite time interval.  \n \n(C) If a signal can be expressed as a weighted sum of shifted one sided exponentials, then its Laplace \ntransform will have no poles.  \n \n(D) The number of finite poles and finite zeroes must be equal.  \nAns. \n(B) \nSol.\n \nFrom the properties of ROC of Laplace transform :   \n \n1. ROC does not contain any pole \n \n2. ROC of transform of a bounded finite duration signal is entire S-plane \n \nIt can be said that, if a signal is bounded and exists only for finite duration, then ROC is entire s-plane, so \nit can not have any pole as ROC does not contain any pole. \n \nHence, the correct option is (B). \nQuestion 2 \n \nA double pulse measurement for an inductively loaded circuit controlled by the IGBT switch is carried \nout to evaluate the reverse recovery characteristic of the diode, \nD\n, represented approximately as a \npiecewise linear plot of current vs time at diode turn-off. \npar\nL\n is a parasitic inductance due to the wiring\nof the circuit and is in series with the diode.
