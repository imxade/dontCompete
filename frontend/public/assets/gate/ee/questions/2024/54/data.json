(i)\n\n\uf026\n Key Point \n1. \nAt No Load, the rotor speed is very close to the Synchronous speed. So the slip. In this case is very \nless (or) near zero\n\ud835\udc60\u22480\n\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc60\n\u2212\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc5f\n2. \n Slip(\ud835\udc60) =\n\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc60\n3.  As load Increase the rotor speed decrease and increasing the slip. \n4.  Slip of an induction motor is 1 at the start and it decrease as rotor gaining speed. \n5.  In the case of slip ring induction motor the rotor resistance is increased by the addition of external\nresistance. This External resistance makes the rotor circuit current \n2\n( )\nI\n Low. Hence by increasing\nthe rotor resistance we can improve the starting. Torque of the wound rotor induction Motor \n(SRIM). \n6.  In squirrel cage type. External resistance addition is not possible.\nFrom equation (i)\n'\n2\n5\next\nR\nR\nS\n\uf02b\n\uf03d\n\nTo Have maximum Torque at starting\n\ud835\udc46= 1\n\u2032\n + \ud835\udc45\next \n= 5\n\ud835\udc45\n2\n\ud835\udc45\next \n= (5 \u22122.5)\n\ud835\udc45\next \n= 2.5 \u03a9\n2\n1\nRext Referred to rotor side is \n= (\nRest\n3\n)\n\nPAGE\n60\n\n1\n=\n9\n \n\u00d7 2.5 = 0.277\u03a9\nHence the correct answer is (0.277).",
