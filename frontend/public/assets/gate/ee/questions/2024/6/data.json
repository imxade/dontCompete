\n \n(A) The percentage increase in fuel consumption from 2010 to 2015 is more than the percentage increase\nin fuel consumption from 2015 to 2020. \n \n(B) The increase in the number of Millennial car buyers from 2015 to 2020 is less than the decrease in\nthe number of Gen X car buyers from 2010 to 2015. \n \n(C) The increase in the number of Millennial car buyers from 2010 to 2015 is more than the decrease in\nthe number of Gen X car buyers from 2010 to 2015.\n\nPAGE\n8\n\n(D) The decrease in the number of Gen X car buyers from 2015 to 2020 is more than the increase in the\nnumber of Millennial car buyers from 2010 to 2015.  \nAns. \n(C) \nSol.\n \n(i) The increase in the number of Millennial car buyers from 2010 to 2015  \n \n \n \n= 45000 \u2013 20000 = 25000 \n \n(ii) The decrease in the number of Gen X Car buyers from 2010 to 2015  \n \n \n \n= 40000 \u2013 30000 = 10000 \n \nSo, the increase in the number of millennial car buyers from 2010 to 2015 is more than the decrease in the \nnumber of Gen X Car buyers from 2010 to 2015. \n \nHence, the correct option is (C). \nQuestion 9  \n \nThe assembly shown below has three teethed circular objects (Pinions) and two teethed flat objects \n(Racks), which are perfectly mating with each other. Pinions can only rotate clockwise or anti-clockwise \nstaying at its own center. Racks can translate towards the left \n(\n)\n\uf0ac\n or the right \n(\n)\n\uf0ae\ndirection.\nIf the object \nA\n (Rack) is translating towards the right \n(\n)\n\uf0ae\n direction, the correct statement among the\nfollowing is \n \n(A) Object \nB\n translates towards the right direction.  \n \n(B) Object \nB\n translates towards the left direction. \n \n(C) Object \nR\n rotates in the anticlockwise direction. \n \n(D) Object \nQ\n rotates in the clockwise direction. \nAns. \n(B) \nSol. \nObject \n\ud835\udc35\n translate towards the left direction \n \nHence the correct option is (B).\n \nQuestion 10\n\nPAGE\n9\n\nA surveyor has to measure the horizontal distance from her position to a distant reference point C.
