The positive, negative and zero-sequence diagrams of the system are shown \nin figures (ii), (iii) and (iv), respectively. All reactances in the sequence diagrams are in p.u. For a bolted \nline-to-line fault (fault impedance = zero) between phases \u2018\nb\n\u2019 and \u2018\nc\n\u2019 at bus 1, neglecting all pre-fault \ncurrents, the magnitude of the fault current (from phase \u2018\nb\n\u2019 to \u2018\nc\n\u2019) in p.u. is ______ (Round off to 2 decimal \nplaces).\n2\n1\njX\nn\nT\n1\nSynchronous\nMotor\nAlternator\nFigure (i): Single-line diagram of the power system\n2\n1\n2\n1\nj\n0.1\nj\n0.3\nj\n0.1\nj\n0.1\nj\n0.1\nj\n0.3\n\"\nm\nE\n\"\ng\nE\nFigure (ii): Positive-sequence network               Figure (iii): Negative-sequence network\n2\n1\nj\n0.1\nj\n0.05\nj\n0.06\nj\n0.15\nj\n0.09\nFigure (iv): Zero-sequence network \nAns. 7.22 (7.1 to 7.3) \nSol.\n2\n1\nj\n0.1\nj\n0.3\nj\n0.1\n2\n1\n1\n( 0.1\n0.1)|| 0.3\nZ\nj\nj\nj\n\uf03d\n\uf02b\n\nGATE 2023 \n [Forenoon Session]\nElectrical Engineering\nPAGE\n55\n\n1\n0.12\nZ\nj\n\uf03d\n1\n2\n0.12\nZ\nZ\nj\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\n2\na\nI\n+\n1\nZ\n2\nZ\n1\na\nI\n1\n2\na\na\nV\nV\n\uf03d\n+\u2013\na\nE\n\u2013\n\n1 0\n0.12\n0.12\nj\nj\n\uf0d0\n\uf03d\n\uf02b\nE\nI\nZ\nZ\n\uf03d\n\uf02b\na\na\n\n1\n1\n2\n\n0\n4.167\n90\na\nI\n\uf03d\n\uf0d0\uf02d\n1\n2\n1\na\na\nI\nI\n\uf03d\uf02d\n0\n4.167 90\n\uf03d\n\uf0d0\n\n0\n1\n2\nb\nb\nb\nb\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\uf03d\n\uf02b\n\uf02b\n\n0\n1\n2\n2\n(\n0)\na\na\na\nI\nI\nI\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\n\uf02b\uf061\n\uf02b\uf061\n\n1\n2\n0\n(\n)\n7.22 180  pu\nf\nb\na\nI\nI\nI\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\uf061\uf02d\uf061\n\uf03d\n\uf0d0\nHence, the correct answer is 7.22. \nQuestion 61 \nElectromagnetic field (magnetostatic)\nAn infinite surface of linear current density \n\u02c6\n5\nx\nK\na\n\uf03d\n A/m exists on the \nx\n-\ny\n plane, as shown in the figure.\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field intensity (\nH\n) at a point (1, 1, 1) due to the surface current in A/m is \n_______ (Round off to 2 decimal places).\nK\n = 5",
