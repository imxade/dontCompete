It is a disease of \noverproduction, of sudden growth, a growth that is unstoppable, tipped into the abyss of no control. \nModern cell biology encourages us to imagine the cell as a molecular machine. Cancer is that machine \nunable to quench its initial command (to grow) and thus transform into an indestructible, self-propelled \nautomaton. \n \n[Adapted from \nThe Emperor of All Maladies\n by Siddhartha Mukherjee] \n \n(A)  It is a reflection of why cancer seems so modern to most of us.  \n \n(B)  It tells us that modern cell biology uses and promotes metaphors of machinery. \n \n(C)  Modern cell biology encourages metaphors of machinery, and cancer is often imagined as a machine. \n \n(D) Modern cell biology never uses figurative language, such as metaphors, to describe or explain\nanything  \nAns. (D)\nSol. \nGiven :\nWe tend to think of cancer as a \u2018modern\u2019 illness because its metaphors are so modern. It is a disease of \noverproduction, of sudden growth, a growth that is unstoppable, tipped into the abyss of no control. \nModern cell biology encourages us to imagine the cell as a molecular machine. Cancer is that machine \nunable to quench its initial command (to grow) and thus transform into an indestructible, self-propelled \nautomaton. \n \nFrom the given information we can clearly seen the modern cell biology uses figurative language, such as \nmetaphors to describe modern illness cancer. \n \nHence, the correct option is (D).\n\nGATE 2023 \n [Forenoon Session]\nElectrical Engineering\nPAGE\n5\n"
