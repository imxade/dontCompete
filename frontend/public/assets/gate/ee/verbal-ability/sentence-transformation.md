**Sentence Transformation**
=========================

**Introduction**
---------------

In verbal ability, sentence transformation involves converting a given sentence into another form while maintaining its meaning. This topic requires an understanding of grammatical rules and concepts that govern speech and writing. In this theory note, we will cover the key principles and formulas for transforming sentences from direct to indirect speech.

**Core Concepts**
-----------------

### Direct Speech vs. Indirect Speech

*   **Direct Speech**: Quotes the exact words spoken by a person.
    Example: "I am thinking of watching a film this weekend."

*   **Indirect Speech**: Reports what was said without using quotes.

### Changing Tense

When converting from direct to indirect speech, we need to change the tense of the verb. The following table shows the corresponding tenses:

| Direct Speech | Indirect Speech |
| --- | --- |
| Simple Present (e.g., "I am") | Simple Past (e.g., "he said he was") |
| Simple Past (e.g., "I was") | Simple Past Perfect (e.g., "he said he had been") |

### Changing Pronouns

When converting from direct to indirect speech, we need to change the pronouns used in the sentence. The following table shows the corresponding pronouns:

| Direct Speech | Indirect Speech |
| --- | --- |
| First Person (I/We) | Third Person (he/she/they) |
| Second Person (You) | Third Person (he/she/they) |

**Key Formulas/Theorems**
-------------------------

No specific formulas or theorems are required for sentence transformation. However, understanding the grammatical rules and concepts is essential.

**Problem Solving Patterns**
---------------------------

### Step-by-Step Approach

1.  Identify the type of speech (direct or indirect).
2.  Change the tense according to the table above.
3.  Change the pronouns according to the table above.

### Practice Example

Suppose we have a sentence in direct speech: "I am thinking of watching a film this weekend."

To convert it into indirect speech:

1.  Identify the type of speech: Direct Speech
2.  Change the tense: Simple Present (am) → Simple Past (was)
3.  Change the pronouns: First Person (I) → Third Person (he)

The sentence in indirect speech is: "Rafi told Mary that he was thinking of watching a film this weekend."

**Examples with Solutions**
---------------------------

### Example 1

Q: Question 1

Ans. (D)

Solution:

1.  Identify the type of speech: Direct Speech
2.  Change the tense: Simple Present (am) → Simple Past (was)
3.  Change the pronouns: First Person (I) → Third Person (he)

The correct answer is indeed (D): "Rafi told Mary that he was thinking of watching a film this weekend."

### Example 2

Q: Write an indirect speech for "You will have finished your homework by tomorrow".

Solution:

1.  Identify the type of speech: Direct Speech
2.  Change the tense: Simple Future (will have) → Simple Past (had)
3.  Change the pronouns: Second Person (You) → Third Person (he/she/they)

The indirect speech is: "He will have finished his homework by tomorrow."
