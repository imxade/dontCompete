**Case Studies: Verbal Ability**
====================================

**Introduction**
---------------

Verbal ability case studies are a type of question that requires you to analyze and interpret information, often presented in the form of a passage or scenario. These questions test your ability to understand relationships between events, identify patterns, and make logical inferences.

**Core Concepts**
-----------------

When approaching verbal ability case studies, keep the following concepts in mind:

* **Inference**: Making conclusions based on given information.
* **Assumption**: Accepting something as true without direct evidence.
* **Analyzing Relationships**: Understanding how different events or pieces of information are connected.

**Key Formulas/Theorems**
-------------------------

There are no specific formulas or theorems to memorize for verbal ability case studies. Instead, focus on developing your analytical and critical thinking skills.

**Problem Solving Patterns**
---------------------------

To solve verbal ability case studies, follow these patterns:

1.  **Read carefully**: Pay attention to every detail in the passage.
2.  **Identify key information**: Determine what is given and what can be inferred.
3.  **Make logical connections**: Understand relationships between events or pieces of information.
4.  **Eliminate incorrect options**: Based on your analysis, eliminate any answer choices that contradict the passage.

**Examples with Solutions**
---------------------------

### Example 1: EE_2023_4

A recent survey shows that 65% of tobacco users were advised to stop consuming tobacco. The survey also shows that 3 out of 10 tobacco users attempted to stop using tobacco.

Which one of the following options can be logically inferred with certainty?

(A) A majority of tobacco users who were advised to stop consuming tobacco made an attempt to do so.
(B) A majority of tobacco users who were advised to stop consuming tobacco did not attempt to do so.
(C) Approximately 30% of the tobacco users successfully stopped consuming tobacco.
(D) Approximately 65% of tobacco users successfully stopped consuming tobacco.

**Solution**

Let's analyze the passage:

*   65% of tobacco users were advised to stop consuming tobacco.
*   3 out of 10 (or 30%) attempted to stop using tobacco.

We can infer that since only 30% attempted to stop, it is likely that a majority of those who were advised did not attempt to do so. This eliminates options A and C, as we cannot conclude with certainty that they are true. Option D is also incorrect because there is no information about the success rate of those who attempted to stop.

The correct answer is (B) A majority of tobacco users who were advised to stop consuming tobacco did not attempt to do so.

### Example 2: EE_2023_6

Students of all departments of a college who have successfully completed the registration process are eligible to vote in the upcoming college elections. However, by the time the due date of registration was over, it was found that surprisingly none of the students from the Department of Human Sciences had completed the registration process.

Based only on the information provided above, which one of the following sets of statement(s) can be logically inferred with certainty?

(i) All those students who would not be eligible to vote in college elections would certainly belong to the Department of Human Sciences.
(ii) None of the students from departments other than Human Sciences failed to complete the registration process within the due date.

**Solution**

Let's analyze the passage:

*   Students of all departments are eligible to vote if they have completed registration.
*   No students from the Department of Human Sciences had completed registration.

We can infer that since no students from the Department of Human Sciences were registered, it is certain that those who were not registered (and therefore not eligible) would belong to this department. This makes statement (i) true. However, there is no information about students from other departments failing to register, so statement (ii) cannot be inferred with certainty.

The correct answer is (D) Statement (i) is true.

**Common Pitfalls**
-------------------

When solving verbal ability case studies, be careful not to:

*   Make assumptions without direct evidence.
*   Overlook crucial details in the passage.
*   Jump to conclusions based on incomplete information.

**Quick Summary**
-----------------

To master verbal ability case studies, remember to:

*   Read carefully and identify key information.
*   Analyze relationships between events or pieces of information.
*   Make logical connections and eliminate incorrect options.
*   Avoid making assumptions without direct evidence.
