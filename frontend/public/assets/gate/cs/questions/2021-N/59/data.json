  "answer_text": "(B), (D)",
  "explanation_text": "Sol.\n \nS1: For n \u00d7 n matrices n\n2\n entries will be there, for each entry we are having 3 choices, one of a, b and \nc. therefore total possible ways matrix can be built is 3\nn^2\n, i.e., 3\nn^2 \nelements in Set 1\nS2: Set A consists element from 0 to n\n2\n \u2013 1, in totality n\n2\n elements are there, in Set B only 3 elements \nare there namely 0,1,2. Therefore total number of functions possible from Set A to Set B are 3\nn^2\n. i.e., \n3\nn^2\n elements in Set 2\nTherefore, both Bijection and Surjection may exist from Set1 to Set 2 as both are having same \nnumber of elements."
