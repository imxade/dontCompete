  "answer_text": "(A), (B), (D)",
  "explanation_text": "Sol.\n \nOption A: Round Robin policy can be used even when the CPU time required by each of the \nprocesses is not known in apriori. This is True because Round Robin policy depends on time \nquantum.\nOption B: Implementing preemptive scheduling needs hardware support. This is True because \npreemption needs interrupt to occur.\nOption C: The goal is to only maximize CPU utilization and minimize throughput, this is False\nOption D: True, because turn around time = WT+BT"
