Given a \nstring, it produces another string by replacing the first 1 in any subsequence of consecutive 1\u2019s by a \n0. Consider the following example.\nInput sequence: 00100011000011100\nOutput sequence: 00000001000001100\nA Mealy Machine is a state machine where both the next state and the output are functions of the \npresent state and the current input.\nThe above mentioned circuit can be designed as a two-state Mealy machine. The states in the Mealv \nmachine can be represented using Boolean values 0 and 1. We denote the current state, the next state, \nthe next incoming bit, and the output bit of the Mealv machine by the variables s, t, b and y \nrespectively. Assume the initial state of the Mealv machine is 0.\nWhat are the Boolean expressions corresponding to t and y in terms of .s and b?\n(A) \nt\nb\ny\nsb\n=\n=\n(B) \nt\ns\nb\ny\nsb\n=\n+\n=\n=\n(C) \nt\nb\n=\ny\nsb\n(D) \nt\ns\nb\ny\nsb\n=\n+\n=",
