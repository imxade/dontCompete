Further, for a vertex v other than s. the \nquality-score of v is defined to be the maximum among the quality-scores of all the paths from s to v. \nThe quality-score of s is assumed to be 1.\ng\nt\nf\n1\n1\n9\n9\nc\nd\ne\n9\n1\n9\n1\n1\n1\n9\n1\nb\na\ns\nThe sum of the quality-score of all the vertices in the graph shown above is____",
