Each letter of a string must be assigned a binary code satisfying the \nfollowing properties.\n1.  \nFor any two letters the code to one letter must be a prefix of code assigned to another \nletter.\n2. \n For any two letters of the same frequency , the letter which occurs earlier in the \ndictionary order is assigned a code whose length is at most the length of code assigned \nto another letter.\nAmong a set of all binary code assignments which satisfy above two properties.
