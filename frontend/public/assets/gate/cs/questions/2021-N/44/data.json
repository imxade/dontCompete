  "explanation_text": "Sol.\n \nA cache with a write through policy (and write allocate) reads on entire block (cache line) from \nmemory on a cache miss and writes only the updated item to memory for a  store.\n\nPAGE\n32\n\nEvictions do not need to write to memory.\nA cache with a write back policy (and write allocate) reads an entire block (cache line) from memory \non a cache miss, and may need to write a dirty cache line first. Any writes to memory need to be \nentire cache lines since there is no way to distinguish which word was dirty with only a single dirty \nbit. Evictions of a dirty cache line cause a write to memory\nS2: false\nWrite allocate policy is also used with write back cache."
