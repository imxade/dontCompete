(A) \nSol. \nS1:\nEvery infinite regular language contains an undecidable language as subset.\nTrue\nIf we consider infinite regular language set as L. As per definition L has infinite many strings.\n\nPAGE\n24\n\nWe know, \n|\n| |\n( ) |\nL\nP L\n\uf03c\n, here \n( )\nP L\n  denote power set of language set, L by cantor theorem we \nknow if L is infinite countable or infinite uncountable \n( )\nP L\n  power set of L is uncountable \n(Infinite) It\u2019s power set consist of decidable and some undecidable language both.\nS2:\nEvery finite language is regular as we have finite number of strings for example \n1\n2\n{\n,\n,........\n}\nn\nS S\nS\n, where \nn\nN\n\uf0ce\n.\nWe can have regular expression always\n1\n2\n......\nn\nR\nS\nS\nS\n=\n+\n+\n+\nTrue",
