Assume that R \ndoes not initially know the shortest routes to P and Q. Assume that R has three neighbouring routers \ndenoted as X, Y. and Z. During one iteration, R measures its distance to its neighbours X, Y, and Z \nas 3, 2, and 5, respectively. Router R gets routing vectors from its neighbours that indicate that the \ndistance to router P from routers X, Y, and Z are 7, 6, and 5, respectively. The routing vector also \nindicates that the distance to router Q from routers X. Y, and Z are 4, 6, and 8 respectively. Which of \nthe following statement(s) is/are correct with respect to the new routing table of R, after updation \nduring this iteration?\n(A) The distance from R to P will be stored as 10\n(B) The next hop router for a packet from R to P is Y\n(C) The distance from R to Q will be stored as 7\n(D) The next hop router for a packet from R to Q is Z",
