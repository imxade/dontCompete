Each stage of the pipeline, except the \nEX-stage, takes one cycle. Assume that the ID stage merely decodes the instruction and the register \nread is performed in the EX-stage. The EX-stage takes one cycle for ADD instruction and two cycles \nfor MUL instruction. Ignore pipeline register latencies. \nConsider the following sequence of 8 instructions:\nADD, MUL, ADD, MUL, ADD, MUL, ADD, MUL\nAssume that every MUL instruction is data-dependent on the ADD instruction just before it and \nevery ADD instruction (except the first ADD) is data-dependent on the MUL instruction just before \nit. The Speedup is defined as follows:\n\nSpeedup = \nExecution time without operand forwarding\nExecution time with operand forwarding\nThe Speedup achieved in executing the given instruction sequence 011 the pipelined processor \n(rounded to 2 decimal places) is_____",
