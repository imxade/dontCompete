  "explanation_text": "Sol. \nEach process has its own address space. \n1.\n \nP1:\nTwo threads T\n11\n,T\n12\n are created in main. \nBoth execute foo function and threads don\u2019t wait for each other. Due to explicit locking mechanism \nhere mutual exclusion is there and hence no race condition inside foo(). \ny being thread local, both the threads will print the value of y as 1. \nDue to the wait in main, the print(x) will happen only after both the threads finish. So, x will have \nbecome 2.  \nPS: Even if x was not assigned 0 explicitly in C all global and static variables are initialized \nto 0 value. \n2.\n \nP2:\n\nPAGE\n19\n\nSame thing happens here as P1 as this is a different process.
