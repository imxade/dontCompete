  "question_text": "Question 61\n \n \nA processor uses a 32-bit instruction format and supports byte-addressable memory access. The ISA of\nthe processor has 150 distinct instructions. The instructions are equally divided into two types, namely\nR-type and I-type. whose formats are shown below.\nR-type Instruction Format:\nOPCODE \nUNUSED \nDST Register \nSRC Register 1 \nSRC Register 2\nI-type Instruction Format:\nOPCODE \nDST Register \nSRC Register \n# Immediate value/address\nIn the OPCODE. 1 bit is used to distinguish between I-type and R-type instructions and the remaining\nbits indicate the operation. The processor has 50 architectural registers, and all register fields in the\ninstructions are of equal size.\nLet\n X\n be the number of bits used to encode the UNUSED field. \nY\n be the number of bits used to encode\nthe OPCODE field, and \nZ\n be the number of bits used to encode the immediate value/address field. The\nvalue of \n2\nX\nY\nZ\n\uf02b\n\uf02b\n is ___________.\n[Computer Organization & Architecture, 1 Machine Instruction & Addressing Format]",

  "explanation_text": "Sol.\n \nOpcode field (\nY\n) :\nThere are 150 instructions, and they are equally divided into two types.  Therefore, there are 75 \nI\n-type \ninstructions and 75 \nR\n-type instructions.  Since one bit is used to distinguish between instruction types, the \nnumber of bits used to encode opcode field is \n(1 7)\n8\nY\n \uf03d\n\uf02b\n\uf03d\nRegister field :\nThere are 50 architectural registers and all register fields in the instructions are of equal size.  Therefore, \nthe number of bits used to encode register field is 6.\n\nPAGE\n42\n\nUnused field (\nX\n) :\nThe number of bits used to encode unused field in \nR\n-type instructions is \nX\n \n32 (8 6\n6\n6)\n6\n\uf03d\n\uf02d\n\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\n\uf03d\nImmediate value/address field (\nZ\n) :\nThe number of bits used to encode immediate value/address field in \nI\n-type instructions is\n32\n(8\n6\n6)\n12\nZ\n \uf03d\n\uf02d\n\uf02b\uf02b\n\uf03d\nTherefore, the values of \nX\n, \nY\n, and \nZ\n are :\nX\n = 6 bits (UNUSED field)\nY\n = 8 bits (OPCODE field)\nZ\n = 12 bits (immediate value/address field)\nSo, the answer is \n6\n2 8 12\n34\n\uf02b\uf0b4\uf02b\n\uf03d\nHence, the correct answer is 34."
