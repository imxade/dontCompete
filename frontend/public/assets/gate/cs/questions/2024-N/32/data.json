  "answer_text": "",
  "explanation_text": "Sol.\n \n(A) Source IP remains unchanged\n(B) Protocol indicates type of data carried [TCP, UDP] and is not altered by routers.\n(C) TTL value is decremented by l by each router that forward packet.\n(D) As TTL value of IP header is changed by every router, corresponding header checksum is\nrecalculated based on the new value of TTL.\nHence, the correct option is (C) and (D)."
