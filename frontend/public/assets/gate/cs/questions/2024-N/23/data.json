The packets from \nX\n to \nY\n go through an intermediate IP \nrouter \nR\n. Ethernet switch \nS\n is the first switch on the network path between \nX\n and \nR\n. Consider a packet sent \nfrom \nX\n to \nY\n over this connection.\nWhich of the following statements is/are TRUE about the destination IP and MAC addresses on this \n \npacket at the time it leaves \nX \n?\n(A) The destination MAC address is the MAC address of \nS\n(B) The destination IP address is the IP address of \nR\n(C) The destination IP address is the IP address of \nY\n(D) The destination MAC address is the MAC address of \nY",

But \nX \nsend packet always default gateway router \nR\n and in path comes switch only forwarding the packet.\nHence, the correct option is (B)."
