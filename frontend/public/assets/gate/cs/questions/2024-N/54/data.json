Assuming that all the segments \ntransmitted in the next two RTTs (Round Trip Time) are acknowledged correctly, the congestion window \nsize (in \nMSS\n) during the third RTT will be _________. \n \n \n \n[Computer Network, 4 Transport Layer] \nAns. \n(4 to 4) \nSol.\n \nGiven cwnd = 12 MSS\nNow timeout occurs which makes, cwnd = 1 and ssthreshold \n12\n6MSS\n2\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\nAgain slow start phase will begin.\nAfter 1 RTT, cwnd = 1 MSS.\nAfter 2 RTT, cwnd = 2 MSS.\n1\n2\n4\nRTT-1 RTT-2\nRTT-3\n\nDuring \nrd\n3\n  RTT cwnd will be 4 MSS.\nHence, the correct answer is 4.",
