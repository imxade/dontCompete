The unit is then redesigned to operate on a 5-stage pipeline at 2 GHz.  Assume \nthat the ideal throughput of the pipelined unit is 1 instruction per cycle.  In the execution of program \nP\n ,\n\nPAGE\n39\n\n20% instructions incur an average of 2 cycles stall due to data hazards and 20% instructions incur an \naverage of 3 cycles stall due to control hazards.  The speedup (rounded off to one decimal place) obtained \nby the pipelined design over the non-pipelined design is _______.\n[Computer Organization & Architecture, 3 Instruction Pipelining]\n \nAns. \n3 (2.9 to 3.1) \nSol.\n \nFor non-pipelined :\n9\n1\n1\n1\nsecond\nFrequency\n2GHz\n2 1\n0.5 \n0\nns\nn\nT\n \uf03d\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\n\uf0b4\nAverage instruction execution time (non-pipelined)\nnon-pipelined\nn\nCPI\nT\n\uf02a\n6 0.5ns\n3.0ns\n\uf02a\n\uf03d\nFor pipelined :\n9\n1\n1\n1\nsecond\nFrequency\n2GHz\n2 1\n0.5 \n0\nns\np\nT\n \uf03d\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\n\uf0b4\nAverage instruction execution time (pipelined)\npipelined\np\nCPI\nT\n\uf02a\n2 0.5ns\n1ns\n\uf02a\n\uf03d\nProgram\nHazard\nData\nHazard\nInstruction\nControl\nRemaining\n20%\n20%\n60%\n(1 +2)\n(1 +3)\n(1 +0)\n\nStall\nStall\nStall\npipelined\n0.6(1 0)\n0.2(1 3)\n0.2(1 2)\nCPI\n\uf03d\n\uf02b\n\uf02b\n\uf02b\n\uf02b\n\uf02b\npipelined\n0.6 1 0.2 4\n0.2 3\nCPI\n\uf03d\n\uf0b4\uf02b\n\uf0b4\uf02b\n\uf0b4\npipelined\n0.6\n0.8\n0.6\n2.0\nCPI\n\uf03d\n\uf02b\n\uf02b\n\uf03d\nT\nT\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\nSpeed up \n3ns\n3\n1ns\nn\np\n\nPAGE\n40\n\nHence, the correct answer is 3.",
