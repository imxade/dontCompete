Each \njob is assigned to a computer such that: \n \n\uf09f\n The fastest computer gets the toughest job and the slowest computer gets the easiest job. \n \n\uf09f\n Every computer gets at least one job. \n \nThe number of ways in which this can be done is_____. \nAns. \n65 \nSol. \nAs 2 Jobs are already assigned to Fastest and Slowest Computer (Toughest and Easiest job respectively). \nWe are only left with 4 distinct Jobs to be distributed to 3 distinct Computers. Intermediate has not been \nassigned any, other have got one each, therefore 4 jobs to be distributed such that intermediate must get \nat least one. \nFastest  \nIntermediate  \nSlowest\n\nGATE 2021\n [Forenoon Session]\nComputer Science Engineering\nPAGE\n31\n\n2 \n \n \n1 \n \n1\n1 \n \n \n1 \n \n2\n1 \n \n \n2 \n \n1\n2 \n \n \n2 \n \n0\n0 \n \n \n2 \n \n2\n3 \n \n \n1 \n \n0\n0 \n \n \n1 \n \n3\n0 \n \n \n3 \n \n1\n1 \n \n \n3 \n \n0\n0 \n \n \n4 \n \n0\nTherefore total cases are 4C2 X 2C1 X 3  +  4C2 X 2   +   4C3 X 4  +   4C4 = 36 +  12 + 16 + 1 = 65",
