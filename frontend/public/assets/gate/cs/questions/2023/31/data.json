We are to shift value of \n5\nr\n  left by \nu\n  places. In code were\nmultiplying element of \nb\n  by 8. So, \n1\n3\n\uf03d\nu\n, which is same as multiplying value by 8 or \n3\n2\n .\nAlso, \n3\nr\n  and \n4\nr\n  stores storing address of next element of arrays \na\n and v. Since it\u2019s 32 bit system and size\nof int is 4B so well increment by 4 so, value of \n2\nu\n  and \n3\nu\n  s 4.\nWe have to jump to short of code i.e. \n01\nL\n so that for-loop can be run.\nSo, \n4\nu\n  is \n01\nL\n.\nHence, the correct option is (B). \n \n:\n \nMethod 2 \n:\n \n \nSince memory is byte addressable and integer is 32 bit means 4 byte.\nSo increment variables and byte needed to add.\nLO5\n :  add \n3\n3\n2\n, ,\nr r U\n                       \n3\n3\n2\nr\nr\nu\n\uf0ac\n\uf02b\nHere,  \n2\n4\nU\n\uf03d\nSimilarly,  \n3\n4\nU\n \uf03d\n8\nJUMPU4;gotoU4\nLO\n \uf03d\nThis instruction move the control to comparison condition\nSo,  \n4\n1\nU\nLO\n\uf03d\nHence, option B is correct.\n1\n3,\n2\n4,\n3\n4,\n4\n1\nU\nU\nU\nU\nLO\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\n\uf03d",
