The computer system \npolls the keyboard every 10 ms (milli seconds) to check for a keystroke and consumes \n100 s\n\uf06d\n (micro\nseconds) for each poll. If it is determined after polling that a key has been pressed, the system consumes \nan additional 200 \u03bcs to process the keystroke. Let \n1\nT\n  denote the fraction of a second spent in polling and\nprocessing a keystroke. \n \nIn an alternative implementation, the system uses interrupts instead of polling. An interrupt is raised for \nevery keystroke. It takes a total of 1 ms for servicing an interrupt and processing a keystroke. Let \n2\nT\n denote\nthe fraction of a second spent in servicing the interrupt and processing a keystroke.\nT\nT\n \n is__________.
