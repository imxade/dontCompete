The processes arrive in the order \nP\n, \nQ\n, \nR\n, \nS\n all at time \n0.\nt\n \uf03d\nThere is exactly one \ncontext switch from \nS\n to \nQ\n, exactly one context switch from \nR\n to \nQ\n. Exactly two context switches from \nQ\n \nto \nR\n. There is no context switch from \nS\n to \nP\n. Switching to a ready process after the termination of another \nprocess is also considered a context switch.
