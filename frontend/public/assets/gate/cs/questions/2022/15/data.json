If \nL\n  is recursively enumerable Language, then for all nonmember strings of L. The TM of \nL\n  \nwill halt within finite time. Thus for both member and nonmember strings of L and \nL\n  we have a TM \nwhich halts within finite time. Thus \nL\n is a Recursive Language.\nOption D:\n True\nComplement of CFL is a CSL in the worst case which is Recursive."
