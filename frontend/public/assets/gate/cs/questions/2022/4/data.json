Assume that no records are \ncalled anywhere across the DNS servers and the iterative query resolution mechanism is used in the\n\nGATE 2022 \n [Forenoon Session]\nComputer Science Engineering\nPAGE\n4\n\nresolution. The number of DNS query response pairs involved in completely resolving the domain name \nis ____. \n \n \n[2 Marks, NAT\n]\nSol.\n \nIn the iterative query the DNS resolver go to the these three servers which is root server, TLD DNS server, \nauthoritative server. So there will be three pairs of request and response here.\nCompiler Design"
