True\n\n\nB. \nTrue\nRed\nGreen\nGreen\nGreen\nBlue\nBlue\nBlue\nRed\n\nGreen\nRed\nC. \nFalse:\nA set of vertices I is called an independent set if no two vertices in set I are adjacent to each other \nor in other words the set of non-adjacent vertices is called an independent set.\n\nGATE 2022 \n [Forenoon Session]\nComputer Science Engineering\nPAGE\n20\n\nIt is 4. From option B by simply keeping all the green vertices together we can simply observe that \nlargest independent set contains 4 vertices.\nD. \nTrue :\nWe can say given graphs are isomorphic if they have :\n1. \nEqual number of vertices\n2. \nEqual number of edges\n3. \nSame degree sequence\n4. \nSame number of circuit of particular length\nNote : In most graphs checking the first three conditions is enough."
