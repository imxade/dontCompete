Balls are drawn from the box one at a time. If a green ball is drawn it is not \nreplaced. If an orange ball is drawn it is replaced with another orange ball. First ball is drawn. What is the \nprobability of getting an orange ball in the next drawn ?\n25\n \n \n(D) \n1\n(A) \n23\n50\n \n \n(B) \n19\n50\n \n \n(C) \n8\n2",
