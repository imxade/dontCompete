Node \nP\n sends a file of size\n6\n10\n  bytes to \nR\n via this path by splitting the file into chunks of \n3\n10\n  bytes each.  Node \nP\n sends these chunks \none after the other without any wait time between the successive chunk transmissions.  Assume that the \nsize of extra headers added to these chunks is negligible, and that the chunk size is less than the MTU.\nEach of the links \nP\nQ\n\uf02d\n and \nQ\nR\n\uf02d\n has a bandwidth of \n6\n10\n  bits/sec, and negligible propagation latency.\nRouter \nQ\n immediately transmits every packet it receives from \nP\n  to \nR\n , with negligible processing and\nqueueing delays.  Router \nQ\n can simultaneously receive on link \nP\nQ\n\uf02d\n and transmit on link \nQ\nR\n\uf02d\n.\nAssume \nP\n  starts transmitting the chunks at time \n0\nt\n \uf03d\n. \n \nWhich one of the following options gives the time (in seconds, rounded off to 3 decimal places) at which  \n \nR\n  receives all the chunks of the file ? \n \n(A) 8.000 \n(B) 8.008 \n \n(C) 15.992 \n(D) 16,000 \nAns. \n(B)",
