Both of them use the LRU (Least Recently Used) block \nreplacement policy.  The cache memory is connected to the main memory.  Which of the following \nstatements is/are TRUE ? \n \n(A) A read miss in WBC never evicts a dirty block \n \n(B) A read miss in WTC never triggers a write back operation of a cache block to main memory \n \n(C) A write hit in WBC can modify the value of the dirty bit of a cache block \n \n(D) A write miss in WTC always writes the victim cache block to main memory before loading the\nmissed block to the cache \nAns. \n(B,C)",
  "answer_text": "",
  "explanation_text": "Sol.\n \nIn write through policy , data is we never need to perform a \u201cwrite back\u201d operation to remove any entry \nfrom the cache block.\nHence, the correct option is (B) and (C)."
