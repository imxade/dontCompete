  "question_text": "Question 58 \n \n  \n[Computer Network (Network Layer)]\n \n \nConsider the entries shown below in the forwarding table of an IP router.  Each entry consists of an IP \nprefix and the corresponding next hop router for packets whose destination IP address matches the prefix.  \nThe notation \u201c/N\u201d in a prefix indicates a subnet mask with the most significant N bits set to 1.\nPrefix\n \nNext hop router\n \n10.1.1.0/24 \nR1\n10.1.1.128/25 \nR2\n10.1.1.64/26 \nR3\n10.1.1.192/26 \nR4\nThis router forwards 20 packets each to 5 hosts.  The IP addresses of the hosts are 10.1.1.16, 10.1.1.72, \n10.1.1.132, 10.1.1.191, and 10.1.1.205.  The number of packets forwarded via the next hop router R2 is \n_________. \nAns. \n(40 to 40)",
