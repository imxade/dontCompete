**Verbal Ability: General Aptitude**
=====================================

**Introduction**
---------------

Verbal ability is a crucial component of the GATE CS exam, testing one's understanding and application of language skills. This section assesses your ability to reason logically, analyze information, and arrive at correct conclusions.

**Core Concepts**
-----------------

### 1. **Prepositions**

*   Prepositions indicate relationships between words or phrases within sentences.
*   Common prepositions include:
    *   In
    *   On
    *   At
    *   By
    *   With
    *   From
    *   To

**Key Formulas/Theorems**
-------------------------

None apply directly to verbal ability.

**Problem Solving Patterns**
---------------------------

### 1. **Inference and Logical Reasoning**

*   Identify the main idea or conclusion based on the given information.
*   Use logical reasoning to arrive at a correct inference.
*   Be cautious of ambiguous language and multiple possible interpretations.

### 2. **Word Analogy**

*   Identify the relationship between words in an analogy.
*   Apply this relationship to find the missing word.

**Examples with Solutions**
---------------------------

### Example 1: Inference

In a currently conducted National Entrance Test, Boys constituted 65% of those who appeared for the test. Girls constituted the remaining candidates and they accounted for 60% of the qualified candidates. Which one of the following is the correct logical inference based on the information provided in the above passage?

(A) Equal number of boys and girls appeared for the test.

(B) The number of boys who qualified the test is less than the number of girls who qualified.

(C) The number of boys who appeared for the test is less than the number of girls who appeared.

(D) Equal number of boys and girls qualified.

**Solution:**

Since boys constituted 65% of those who appeared for the test, and girls accounted for the remaining 35%, it's clear that there were more boys in the test. Therefore, option (C) is correct.

### Example 2: Word Analogy

Pen: Write :: Knife :_____

Which one of the following options maintains a similar logical relation in the above?

(A) Sharp

(B) Cut

(C) Blunt

(D) Vegetables.

**Solution:**

The analogy between "pen" and "write" is that a pen is used to write. Similarly, the missing word should be related to what a knife is typically used for. The correct option is (B), as a knife is often used to cut.

### Example 3: Logical Reasoning

If two distinct non-zero variables x and y are such that (x + y) / (xy) is proportional to (x - y) / (xy), then the value of xy is:

(A) Depends on xy

(B) Dependent on xy but not equal to it.

(C) Equal to 1.

(D) Constant.

**Solution:**

Given (x + y) / (xy) = k(x - y) / (xy), where k is a constant, we can simplify this expression by canceling out the denominators. This leaves us with (x + y) = k(x - y). Rearranging terms yields x = ky. Since xy must be constant for all values of x and y, it follows that xy equals the value of k.

### Example 4: Logical Reasoning

Given below are four statements:

Statement 1: All students are inquisitive.

Statement 2: Some students are inquisitive.

Statement 3: No students are inquisitive.

Statement 4: Some students are not inquisitive.

For the given four statements, find the statements what cannot be true, simultaneously, assuming that there is at least one student in the class.

(A) Statement 1 and Statement 3

(B) Statement 3 and Statement 4

(C) Statement 2 and Statement 4

(D) Statement 1 and Statement 2

**Solution:**

If statement 1 were true, then all students would be inquisitive. This contradicts statement 3, which states that no students are inquisitive. Therefore, statements 1 and 3 cannot both be true.

### Example 5: Prepositions

Steve was advised to keep his head ___(i)___ before heading ___(ii)___ to bat; for, while he had a head ___(iii)___ batting, lie could only do so with a cool head ___(iv)__ his shoulders.

Which of the following options is the correct completion?

(A) (i) down  (ii) down (iii) on (iv) for

(B) (i) on  (ii) down (iii) for (iv) on

(C) (i) down  (ii) out (iii) for (iv) on

(D) (i) on  (ii) out (iii) on (iv) for

**Solution:**

The correct completion is (C). Steve was advised to keep his head "down" before heading "out" to bat. While he had a head "for" batting, he could only do so with a cool head "on" his shoulders.

**Common Pitfalls**
-------------------

*   Be cautious of ambiguous language and multiple possible interpretations.
*   Avoid making assumptions not supported by the given information.
*   Use logical reasoning to arrive at correct inferences.

**Quick Summary**
------------------

*   Identify main ideas or conclusions based on the given information.
*   Apply logical reasoning to arrive at correct inferences.
*   Be cautious of prepositions and their relationships within sentences.
