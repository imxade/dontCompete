**Context-Free Grammars and Push Down Automata**
====================================================

### Introduction

Context-free grammars (CFGs) and push down automata (PDAs) are fundamental concepts in the theory of computation. A CFG is a set of production rules that generate strings from a given alphabet, while a PDA is a type of automaton that uses a stack to recognize languages generated by a CFG.

### Core Concepts

#### Context-Free Grammars

A context-free grammar $G$ consists of:

*   A set of terminals $\Sigma$
*   A set of non-terminals $N$
*   A start symbol $S \in N$
*   A set of production rules $P$

The production rules are of the form $A \to \alpha$, where $A$ is a non-terminal and $\alpha$ is a string consisting of terminals and/or non-terminals.

**Definition:** The language generated by a CFG $G$ is denoted by $L(G)$ and is defined as:

$L(G) = \{w \in \Sigma^* \mid S \Rightarrow^* w\}$

where $\Rightarrow^*$ denotes the reflexive transitive closure of the derivation relation.

#### Push Down Automata

A push down automaton $M$ consists of:

*   A finite set of states $Q$
*   An input alphabet $\Sigma$
*   A stack alphabet $\Gamma$
*   A start state $q_0 \in Q$
*   A set of transition rules $\delta$

The transition rules are of the form $(q, a, X) \to (p, \alpha)$, where $q$ and $p$ are states, $a$ is an input symbol, $X$ is a stack symbol, and $\alpha$ is a string consisting of input symbols and/or stack symbols.

**Definition:** The language recognized by a PDA $M$ is denoted by $L(M)$ and is defined as:

$L(M) = \{w \in \Sigma^* \mid \exists s_0 \in S_0, q_0 \in Q, q_f \in F, \text{such that } (q_0, w, s_0) \Rightarrow^* (q_f, \epsilon, s)\}$

where $\Rightarrow^*$ denotes the reflexive transitive closure of the transition relation.

### Key Formulas/Theorems

#### Pumping Lemma for CFGs

**Theorem:** Let $G$ be a context-free grammar and $w$ be a string in $L(G)$. Then, there exists an integer $p > 0$ such that:

$$\frac{|w|}{p} \geq 2 \quad \text{and} \quad w = uv^iwx^iy \quad \forall i \geq 0$$

where $u, v, x, y$ are strings and $v$ is not empty.

#### Closure Properties of CFGs

**Theorem:** The class of context-free languages is closed under the following operations:

1.  Union: $L_1 \cup L_2$ is context-free if both $L_1$ and $L_2$ are context-free.
2.  Concatenation: $L_1 L_2$ is context-free if both $L_1$ and $L_2$ are context-free.
3.  Kleene star: $L^*$ is context-free if $L$ is context-free.

### Problem Solving Patterns

#### Analyzing the GOTO Table

To find the number of items in the set GOTO(GOTO(0, ), I ), we need to analyze the transitions from each state.

**Example:**

Consider the PDA defined by the following transition rules:

$(q_0, a) \to (q_1, aS)$
$(q_1, b) \to (q_2, \epsilon)$

We want to find the number of items in GOTO(GOTO(0, ), I ).

*   From state $q_0$, we can transition to $q_1$ on input $a$. Therefore, $(q_0, a) \in GOTO(0, )$
*   From state $q_1$, we can transition to $q_2$ on input $b$. Therefore, $(q_1, b) \in GOTO(q_0, )$

Since there are no other transitions from states $q_0$ and $q_1$, the number of items in GOTO(GOTO(0, ), I ) is 2.

#### Counting Derivations

To count the number of derivations of a given string, we need to analyze the production rules of the CFG.

**Example:**

Consider the CFG defined by the following production rules:

$S \to aSb | \epsilon$

We want to find the number of derivations of the string $abab$.

*   We can derive $aSb$ from $\epsilon$ using the production rule $S \to aSb$
*   We can then derive $ab$ by applying the production rule again
*   Finally, we can derive $\epsilon$ by applying the production rule once more

Therefore, there are 3 derivations of the string $abab$.

### Examples with Solutions

**Example 1:**

Consider the PDA defined by the following transition rules:

$(q_0, a) \to (q_1, aS)$
$(q_1, b) \to (q_2, \epsilon)$

Find the number of items in GOTO(GOTO(0, ), I ).

**Solution:**

*   From state $q_0$, we can transition to $q_1$ on input $a$. Therefore, $(q_0, a) \in GOTO(0, )$
*   From state $q_1$, we can transition to $q_2$ on input $b$. Therefore, $(q_1, b) \in GOTO(q_0, )$

Since there are no other transitions from states $q_0$ and $q_1$, the number of items in GOTO(GOTO(0, ), I ) is 2.

**Example 2:**

Consider the CFG defined by the following production rules:

$S \to aSb | \epsilon$

Find the number of derivations of the string $abab$.

**Solution:**

*   We can derive $aSb$ from $\epsilon$ using the production rule $S \to aSb$
*   We can then derive $ab$ by applying the production rule again
*   Finally, we can derive $\epsilon$ by applying the production rule once more

Therefore, there are 3 derivations of the string $abab$.

### Common Pitfalls

*   When analyzing the GOTO table, make sure to consider all possible transitions from each state.
*   When counting derivations, make sure to analyze all possible applications of the production rules.

### Quick Summary

*   Context-free grammars (CFGs) consist of a set of terminals, non-terminals, and production rules.
*   Push down automata (PDAs) use a stack to recognize languages generated by CFGs.
*   The pumping lemma for CFGs states that every string in a context-free language can be broken into five parts, with the first part being able to be repeated any number of times.
