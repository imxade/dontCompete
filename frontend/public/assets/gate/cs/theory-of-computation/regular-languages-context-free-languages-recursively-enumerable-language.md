# Theory of Computation: Regular Languages, Context-Free Languages, and Recursively Enumerable Language
## Introduction

The Theory of Computation deals with the study of computation, focusing on the types of problems that can be solved by different models of computation. This note will cover regular languages, context-free languages, and recursively enumerable languages.

## Core Concepts

### Regular Languages

A regular language is a formal language that can be accepted by a finite automaton (FA). The key property of regular languages is that they are closed under union, concatenation, and Kleene star operations. A regular language can be represented as a regular expression or a deterministic finite automaton (DFA).

### Context-Free Languages

A context-free language is a formal language that can be generated by a context-free grammar (CFG). The key property of context-free languages is that they are closed under substitution and concatenation operations. A context-free language can be represented as a context-free grammar or a pushdown automaton (PDA).

### Recursively Enumerable Language

A recursively enumerable language is a formal language that can be accepted by a Turing machine (TM). The key property of recursively enumerable languages is that they are closed under union and concatenation operations. A recursively enumerable language can be represented as a set of tuples.

## Key Formulas/Theorems

*   **Pumping Lemma**: If L is a regular language, then there exists an integer p such that every string w in L with |w| ≥ p can be written as w = xyz where |y| > 0 and |xzy| ≤ p.
*   **Myhill-Nerode Theorem**: A language L is regular if and only if the equivalence relation R defined by xRy if and only if for all z, xz ∈ L ⇔ yz ∈ L is finite.
*   **Turing Machine (TM) Closure Properties**:
    *   If L1 and L2 are recursively enumerable languages, then L1 ∪ L2 and L1 ∘ L2 are also recursively enumerable.

## Problem Solving Patterns

### Pattern 1: Regular Languages
If a language is regular, it can be represented as a regular expression or a DFA. Use the pumping lemma to prove that a language is not regular.

### Pattern 2: Context-Free Languages
If a language is context-free, it can be represented as a CFG or a PDA. Use the properties of context-free languages to prove that a language is context-free.

### Pattern 3: Recursively Enumerable Language
If a language is recursively enumerable, it can be accepted by a TM. Use the closure properties of recursively enumerable languages to prove that a language is recursively enumerable.

## Examples with Solutions

### Example 1:

Show that the language L = {a^n b^n | n ≥ 0} is context-free.

*   Solution: We can represent L as a CFG G = (V, Σ, P, S) where V = {S}, Σ = {a, b}, P = {S → aSb | ε}, and S is the start symbol. G is a context-free grammar, so L is context-free.

### Example 2:

Show that the language L = {a^n b^m | n ≠ m} is recursively enumerable but not regular.

*   Solution: We can show that L is recursively enumerable by constructing a TM M that accepts L. M works by simulating the process of counting the number of a's and b's in the input string.
*   To show that L is not regular, we use the pumping lemma. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that L is regular. Then there exists an integer p such that every string w in L with |w| ≥ p can be written as w = xyz where |y| > 0 and |xzy| ≤ p.
*   Consider the string a^p b^p. Since |a^p b^p| ≥ p, we have a^p b^p = xyz for some x, y, z. But then |x| + |z| ≥ p, so either x or z must contain more than p symbols.
*   If x contains more than p symbols, then |xy| > p, and a^p b^p = xyb^p ≠ a^p b^p, which is a contradiction.
*   On the other hand, if z contains more than p symbols, then |z| ≥ p, and a^p b^p = xzb^p ≠ a^p b^p, again a contradiction.

## Common Pitfalls

*   Students often confuse regular languages with context-free languages. Make sure to identify which type of language is being described in each problem.
*   When working with recursively enumerable languages, be careful to use the correct closure properties.
*   Do not assume that a language is regular or context-free without providing evidence.

## Quick Summary

This image shows that regular languages are a subset of context-free languages, which in turn are a subset of recursively enumerable languages.
