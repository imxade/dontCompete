**Monoids and Group**
=====================

**Introduction**
---------------

A monoid is a mathematical structure consisting of a set equipped with an associative binary operation and an identity element. A group, on the other hand, is a specific type of monoid where every element has an inverse. In this theory note, we'll cover the core concepts, key formulas/theorems, problem-solving patterns, examples with solutions, common pitfalls, and a quick summary to help you ace your GATE CS exam.

**Core Concepts**
----------------

### Monoids

A **monoid** is defined as:

* A set `G` (often referred to as the group or monoid)
* An associative binary operation $\cdot$ on `G`, i.e., for all $a, b, c \in G$, we have $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$
* An identity element `e` in `G` such that for any $a \in G$, we have $a \cdot e = e \cdot a = a$

Example: The set of integers under addition forms a monoid with 0 as the identity element.

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Monoid] -->|associative binary operation| B[Set]
B -->|identity element| C[Integers]
```

### Groups

A **group** is defined as:

* A set `G` (often referred to as the group)
* An associative binary operation $\cdot$ on `G`, i.e., for all $a, b, c \in G$, we have $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$
* An identity element `e` in `G` such that for any $a \in G$, we have $a \cdot e = e \cdot a = a$
* For every $a \in G$, there exists an inverse element $a^{-1}$ in `G` such that $a \cdot a^{-1} = a^{-1} \cdot a = e$

Example: The set of integers under multiplication forms a group with 1 as the identity element and -1 as the inverse for each non-zero integer.

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Group] -->|associative binary operation| B[Set]
B -->|identity element| C[Integers]
D[Inverse Element] -->|a^-1 such that a \* a^-1 = e| E[Integers]
```

**Key Formulas/Theorems**
-------------------------

LaTeX will be used to display mathematical formulas and theorems.

### Cayley's Theorem

Cayley's theorem states that every group is isomorphic to a permutation group on its elements. Specifically, for any group `G` of order $n$, there exists a subgroup `H` of the symmetric group `S_n` such that `G` is isomorphic to `H`.

$$\text{Cayley's Theorem: } G \cong H \leq S_n$$

### Lagrange's Theorem

Lagrange's theorem states that if `H` is a subgroup of a finite group `G`, then the order of `H` divides the order of `G`.

$$\text{Lagrange's Theorem: } |H| \mid |G|$$

**Problem Solving Patterns**
---------------------------

### Pattern 1: Understanding Group Properties

* Identify the properties of groups, such as associativity and closure.
* Recognize the importance of identity elements and inverses.

```markdown
## Example 1

A group G has order 6. Find all possible orders of subgroups H in G.

| Order of G | Possible Orders of H |
| --- | --- |
| 6 | 1, 2, 3 |

Explanation:
The possible orders of subgroups in a finite group are divisors of the group's order.
```

### Pattern 2: Applying Cayley's and Lagrange's Theorems

* Understand how Cayley's theorem helps establish isomorphisms between groups.
* Apply Lagrange's theorem to determine the number of possible subgroup orders.

```markdown
## Example 2

A group G has order 12. Find all possible orders of subgroups H in G that are cyclic.

| Order of G | Possible Orders of H |
| --- | --- |
| 12 | 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 |

Explanation:
Use Cayley's theorem to establish an isomorphism between G and a permutation group.
Apply Lagrange's theorem to determine the possible orders of subgroups.
```

**Examples with Solutions**
---------------------------

### Example: Q1 (ID: cs_2021-M_1)

Let `G` be a group of order 6, and let `H` be a subgroup of `G` such that `1 < | H | < 6`. Which one of the following options is correct?

(A) Both `G` and `H` may not be cyclic.
(B) Both `G` and `H` are always cyclic.
(C) `G` is always cyclic, but `H` may not be cyclic.
(D) `G` may not be cyclic, but `H` is always cyclic.

Solution:

By Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of subgroups in a group of order 6 are `1`, `2`, `3`, and `6`. Since `H` has an order greater than `1` and less than `6`, it must have an order of `2` or `3`. However, since `G` is cyclic (order `6`), its subgroups will also be cyclic. Therefore, the correct option is `(D)`.

### Example: Understanding Cyclic Groups

Let `G` be a cyclic group of prime order `p`. Prove that every element in `G` generates the entire group.

Solution:

Since `G` has prime order `p`, there are no non-trivial subgroups. By Lagrange's theorem, this implies that the only possible orders of subgroups are `1` and `p`. However, since `G` is cyclic, it must have a subgroup of order `p` generated by any non-identity element.

```markdown
## Example: Understanding Cyclic Groups

A cyclic group G has prime order p. Prove that every element in G generates the entire group.

Explanation:
Use Lagrange's theorem to determine the possible orders of subgroups.
Show that a subgroup of order p can be generated by any non-identity element.
```

**Common Pitfalls**
------------------

* Failing to recognize the importance of associativity and closure in groups.
* Misapplying Cayley's or Lagrange's theorems without understanding their underlying assumptions.

**Quick Summary**
-----------------

* **Monoid**: A set `G` with an associative binary operation and an identity element.
* **Group**: A monoid where every element has an inverse.
* **Cayley's Theorem**: Every group is isomorphic to a permutation group on its elements.
* **Lagrange's Theorem**: The order of a subgroup divides the order of the group.
* **Problem-Solving Patterns**:
	+ Understand group properties and recognize their importance.
	+ Apply Cayley's and Lagrange's theorems correctly.
